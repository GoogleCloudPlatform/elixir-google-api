defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2ExecutionPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  An `ExecutionPolicy` can be used to control the scheduling of the action.

  ## Attributes

  *   `priority` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The priority (relative importance) of this action. Generally, a lower value means that the action should be run sooner than actions having a greater priority value, but the interpretation of a given value is server- dependent. A priority of 0 means the *default* priority. Priorities may be positive or negative, and such actions should run later or sooner than actions having the default priority, respectively. The particular semantics of this field is up to the server. In particular, every server will have their own supported range of priorities, and will decide how these map into scheduling policy.
