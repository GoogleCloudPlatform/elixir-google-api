defmodule GoogleApi.RemoteBuildExecution.V2.Model.BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2OutputSymlink do
  @moduledoc """
  An `OutputSymlink` is similar to a
  Symlink, but it is used as an
  output in an `ActionResult`.

  `OutputSymlink` is binary-compatible with `SymlinkNode`.

  ## Attributes

  *   `path` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The full path of the symlink relative to the working directory, including the
      filename. The path separator is a forward slash `/`. Since this is a
      relative path, it MUST NOT begin with a leading forward slash.
  *   `target` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The target path of the symlink. The path separator is a forward slash `/`.
      The target path can be relative to the parent directory of the symlink or
      it can be an absolute path starting with `/`. Support for absolute paths
      can be checked using the Capabilities
      API. The canonical form forbids the substrings `/./` and `//` in the target
      path. `..` components are allowed anywhere in the target path.
