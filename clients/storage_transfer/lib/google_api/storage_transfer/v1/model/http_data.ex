defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.HttpData do
  @moduledoc """
  An HttpData specifies a list of objects on the web to be transferred over HTTP.  The information of the objects to be transferred is contained in a file referenced by a URL. The first line in the file must be \&quot;TsvHttpData-1.0\&quot;, which specifies the format of the file.  Subsequent lines specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry. Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields:  * HTTP URL - The location of the object.  * Length - The size of the object in bytes.  * MD5 - The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object.  For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/create-url-list).  When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind:  * When an object located at &#x60;http(s)://hostname:port/&lt;URL-path&gt;&#x60; is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is &#x60;&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;URL-path&gt;&#x60;.  * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object will not be transferred.  * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see [Generating MD5 hashes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/transfer/#md5)  * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Google Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it.  * Storage Transfer Service obeys &#x60;robots.txt&#x60; rules and requires the source HTTP server to support &#x60;Range&#x60; requests and to return a &#x60;Content-Length&#x60; header in each response.  * [ObjectConditions](#ObjectConditions) have no effect when filtering objects to transfer.
