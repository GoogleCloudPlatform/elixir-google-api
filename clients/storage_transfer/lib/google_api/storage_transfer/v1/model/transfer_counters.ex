  @moduledoc """
  A collection of counters that report the progress of a transfer operation.

  ## Attributes

  - bytesCopiedToSink (String.t): Bytes that are copied to the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesDeletedFromSink (String.t): Bytes that are deleted from the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesDeletedFromSource (String.t): Bytes that are deleted from the data source. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesFailedToDeleteFromSink (String.t): Bytes that failed to be deleted from the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesFoundFromSource (String.t): Bytes found in the data source that are scheduled to be transferred, excluding any that are filtered based on object conditions or skipped due to sync. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesFoundOnlyFromSink (String.t): Bytes found only in the data sink that are scheduled to be deleted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesFromSourceFailed (String.t): Bytes in the data source that failed to be transferred or that failed to be deleted after being transferred. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bytesFromSourceSkippedBySync (String.t): Bytes in the data source that are not transferred because they already exist in the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsCopiedToSink (String.t): Objects that are copied to the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsDeletedFromSink (String.t): Objects that are deleted from the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsDeletedFromSource (String.t): Objects that are deleted from the data source. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsFailedToDeleteFromSink (String.t): Objects that failed to be deleted from the data sink. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsFoundFromSource (String.t): Objects found in the data source that are scheduled to be transferred, excluding any that are filtered based on object conditions or skipped due to sync. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsFoundOnlyFromSink (String.t): Objects found only in the data sink that are scheduled to be deleted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectsFromSourceFailed (String.t): Objects in the data source that failed to be transferred or that failed to be deleted after being transferred. Defaults to: `null`.
