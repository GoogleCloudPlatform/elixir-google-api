defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.ObjectConditions do
  @moduledoc """
  Conditions that determine which objects will be transferred.

  ## Attributes

  - excludePrefixes (List[String]): &#x60;excludePrefixes&#x60; must follow the requirements described for &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60;.  The max size of &#x60;excludePrefixes&#x60; is 1000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - includePrefixes (List[String]): If &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60; is specified, objects that satisfy the object conditions must have names that start with one of the &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60; and that do not start with any of the &#x60;excludePrefixes&#x60;. If &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60; is not specified, all objects except those that have names starting with one of the &#x60;excludePrefixes&#x60; must satisfy the object conditions.  Requirements:    * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of     Unicode characters, of max length 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and     must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters.  Wildcard     matching and regular expression matching are not supported.    * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash.     For example, to include the &#x60;requests.gz&#x60; object in a transfer from     &#x60;s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y&#x3D;2015/requests.gz&#x60;, specify the include     prefix as &#x60;logs/y&#x3D;2015/requests.gz&#x60;.    * None of the include-prefix or the exclude-prefix values can be empty,     if specified.    * Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object     namespace, i.e., no include-prefix may be a prefix of another     include-prefix.    * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object     namespace, i.e., no exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another     exclude-prefix.    * If &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60; is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start     with the value of a path explicitly included by &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60;.  The max size of &#x60;includePrefixes&#x60; is 1000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification (String): &#x60;maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification&#x60; is the complement to &#x60;minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification (String): If unspecified, &#x60;minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification&#x60; takes a zero value and &#x60;maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification&#x60; takes the maximum possible value of Duration. Objects that satisfy the object conditions must either have a &#x60;lastModificationTime&#x60; greater or equal to &#x60;NOW&#x60; - &#x60;maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification&#x60; and less than &#x60;NOW&#x60; - &#x60;minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification&#x60;, or not have a &#x60;lastModificationTime&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
