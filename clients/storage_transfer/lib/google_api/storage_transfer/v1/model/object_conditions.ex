defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.ObjectConditions do
  @moduledoc """
  Conditions that determine which objects will be transferred. Applies only
  to S3 and Cloud Storage objects.

  The "last modification time" refers to the time of the
  last change to the object's content or metadata â€” specifically, this is
  the `updated` property of Cloud Storage objects and the `LastModified`
  field of S3 objects.

  ## Attributes

  *   `excludePrefixes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - `exclude_prefixes` must follow the requirements described for
      include_prefixes.

      The max size of `exclude_prefixes` is 1000.
  *   `includePrefixes` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - If `include_prefixes` is specified, objects that satisfy the object
      conditions must have names that start with one of the `include_prefixes`
      and that do not start with any of the exclude_prefixes. If
      `include_prefixes` is not specified, all objects except those that have
      names starting with one of the `exclude_prefixes` must satisfy the object
      conditions.

      Requirements:

        * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of
          Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded,
          and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters.  Wildcard
          matching and regular expression matching are not supported.

        * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash.
          For example, to include the `requests.gz` object in a transfer from
          `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the include
          prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`.

        * None of the include-prefix or the exclude-prefix values can be empty,
          if specified.

        * Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object
          namespace. No include-prefix may be a prefix of another
          include-prefix.

        * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object
          namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another
          exclude-prefix.

        * If `include_prefixes` is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start
          with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`.

      The max size of `include_prefixes` is 1000.
  *   `maxTimeElapsedSinceLastModification` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, only objects with a "last modification time" on or after
      `NOW` - `max_time_elapsed_since_last_modification` and objects that don't
      have a "last modification time" are transferred.

      For each TransferOperation started by this TransferJob,
      `NOW` refers to the start_time of the
      `TransferOperation`.
  *   `minTimeElapsedSinceLastModification` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If specified, only objects with a "last modification time" before
      `NOW` - `min_time_elapsed_since_last_modification` and objects that don't
       have a "last modification time" are transferred.

      For each TransferOperation started by this TransferJob, `NOW`
      refers to the start_time of the
      `TransferOperation`.
