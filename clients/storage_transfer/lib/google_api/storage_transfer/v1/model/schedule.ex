defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.Schedule do
  @moduledoc """
  Transfers can be scheduled to recur or to run just once.

  ## Attributes

  *   `scheduleEndDate` (*type:* `GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.Date.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The last day the recurring transfer will be run. If `scheduleEndDate`
      is the same as `scheduleStartDate`, the transfer will be executed only
      once.
  *   `scheduleStartDate` (*type:* `GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.Date.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The first day the recurring transfer is scheduled to run. If
      `scheduleStartDate` is in the past, the transfer will run for the first
      time on the following day.
  *   `startTimeOfDay` (*type:* `GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.TimeOfDay.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time in UTC at which the transfer will be scheduled to start in a day.
      Transfers may start later than this time. If not specified, recurring and
      one-time transfers that are scheduled to run today will run immediately;
      recurring transfers that are scheduled to run on a future date will start
      at approximately midnight UTC on that date. Note that when configuring a
      transfer with the Cloud Platform Console, the transfer's start time in a
      day is specified in your local timezone.
