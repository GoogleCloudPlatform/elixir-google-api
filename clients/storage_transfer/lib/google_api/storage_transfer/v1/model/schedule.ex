defmodule GoogleApi.StorageTransfer.V1.Model.Schedule do
  @moduledoc """
  Transfers can be scheduled to recur or to run just once.

  ## Attributes

  - scheduleEndDate (DateTime): The last day the recurring transfer will be run. If &#x60;scheduleEndDate&#x60; is the same as &#x60;scheduleStartDate&#x60;, the transfer will be executed only once. Defaults to: `null`.
  - scheduleStartDate (DateTime): The first day the recurring transfer is scheduled to run. If &#x60;scheduleStartDate&#x60; is in the past, the transfer will run for the first time on the following day. Required. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTimeOfDay (TimeOfDay): The time in UTC at which the transfer will be scheduled to start in a day. Transfers may start later than this time. If not specified, recurring and one-time transfers that are scheduled to run today will run immediately; recurring transfers that are scheduled to run on a future date will start at approximately midnight UTC on that date. Note that when configuring a transfer with the Cloud Platform Console, the transfer&#39;s start time in a day is specified in your local timezone. Defaults to: `null`.
