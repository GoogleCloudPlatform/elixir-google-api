defmodule GoogleApi.SourceRepo.V1.Model.Policy do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.   A &#x60;Policy&#x60; consists of a list of &#x60;bindings&#x60;. A &#x60;Binding&#x60; binds a list of &#x60;members&#x60; to a &#x60;role&#x60;, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A &#x60;role&#x60; is a named list of permissions defined by IAM.  **Example**      {       \&quot;bindings\&quot;: [         {           \&quot;role\&quot;: \&quot;roles/owner\&quot;,           \&quot;members\&quot;: [             \&quot;user:mike@example.com\&quot;,             \&quot;group:admins@example.com\&quot;,             \&quot;domain:google.com\&quot;,             \&quot;serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\&quot;,           ]         },         {           \&quot;role\&quot;: \&quot;roles/viewer\&quot;,           \&quot;members\&quot;: [\&quot;user:sean@example.com\&quot;]         }       ]     }  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM developer&#39;s guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

  ## Attributes

  - auditConfigs (List[AuditConfig]): Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bindings (List[Binding]): Associates a list of &#x60;members&#x60; to a &#x60;role&#x60;. Multiple &#x60;bindings&#x60; must not be specified for the same &#x60;role&#x60;. &#x60;bindings&#x60; with no members will result in an error. Defaults to: `null`.
  - etag (String): &#x60;etag&#x60; is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the &#x60;etag&#x60; in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An &#x60;etag&#x60; is returned in the response to &#x60;getIamPolicy&#x60;, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to &#x60;setIamPolicy&#x60; to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.  If no &#x60;etag&#x60; is provided in the call to &#x60;setIamPolicy&#x60;, then the existing policy is overwritten blindly. Defaults to: `null`.
  - iamOwned (Boolean):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - rules (List[Rule]): If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied.   Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is   granted.   Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied. Defaults to: `null`.
  - version (Integer): Version of the &#x60;Policy&#x60;. The default version is 0. Defaults to: `null`.
