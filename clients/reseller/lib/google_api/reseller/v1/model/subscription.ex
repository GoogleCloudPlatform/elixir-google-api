  - renewalSettings (RenewalSettings): Renewal settings for the annual commitment plan. For more detailed information, see renewal options in the administrator help center. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resourceUiUrl (String.t): URL to customer&#39;s Subscriptions page in the Admin console. The read-only URL is generated by the API service. This is used if your client application requires the customer to complete a task using the Subscriptions page in the Admin console. Defaults to: `null`.
