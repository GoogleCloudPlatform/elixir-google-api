  ## Attributes

  - description (String.t): An optional user-provided description of the deployment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fingerprint (binary()): Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment, such as update(), stop(), and cancelPreview() requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with update(), stop(), and cancelPreview() requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request happens at a time.  The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a get() request to a deployment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - insertTime (String.t): Output only. Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labels ([DeploymentLabelEntry]): Map of labels; provided by the client when the resource is created or updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)? Defaults to: `null`.
  - manifest (String.t): Output only. URL of the manifest representing the last manifest that was successfully deployed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - operation (Operation): Output only. The Operation that most recently ran, or is currently running, on this deployment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String.t): Output only. Server defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - target (TargetConfiguration): [Input Only] The parameters that define your deployment, including the deployment configuration and relevant templates. Defaults to: `null`.
  - update (DeploymentUpdate): Output only. If Deployment Manager is currently updating or previewing an update to this deployment, the updated configuration appears here. Defaults to: `null`.
  - updateTime (String.t): Output only. Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
