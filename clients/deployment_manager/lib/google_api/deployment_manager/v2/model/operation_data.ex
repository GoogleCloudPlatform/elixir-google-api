  ## Attributes

  - key (String.t): [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding). Defaults to: `null`.
  - value (String.t): [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key. Defaults to: `null`.
