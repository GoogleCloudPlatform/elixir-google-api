defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.LinearBuckets do
  @moduledoc """
  Describing buckets with constant width.

  ## Attributes

  - numFiniteBuckets (Integer): The number of finite buckets. With the underflow and overflow buckets, the total number of buckets is &#x60;num_finite_buckets&#x60; + 2. See comments on &#x60;bucket_options&#x60; for details. Defaults to: `null`.
  - offset (Float): The i&#39;th linear bucket covers the interval   [offset + (i-1) * width, offset + i * width) where i ranges from 1 to num_finite_buckets, inclusive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - width (Float): The i&#39;th linear bucket covers the interval   [offset + (i-1) * width, offset + i * width) where i ranges from 1 to num_finite_buckets, inclusive. Must be strictly positive. Defaults to: `null`.
