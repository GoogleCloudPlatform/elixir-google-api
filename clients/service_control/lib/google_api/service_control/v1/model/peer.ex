defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.Peer do
  @moduledoc """
  This message defines attributes for a node that handles a network request.
  The node can be either a service or an application that sends, forwards,
  or receives the request. Service peers should fill in the `service`,
  `principal`, and `labels` as appropriate.

  ## Attributes

  - ip (String.t): The IP address of the peer. Defaults to `nil`.
  - labels (map()): The labels associated with the peer. Defaults to `nil`.
  - port (String.t): The network port of the peer. Defaults to `nil`.
  - principal (String.t): The identity of this peer. Similar to `Request.auth.principal`, but
  relative to the peer instead of the request. For example, the
  idenity associated with a load balancer that forwared the request. Defaults to `nil`.
  - regionCode (String.t): The CLDR country/region code associated with the above IP address.
  If the IP address is private, the `region_code` should reflect the
  physical location where this peer is running. Defaults to `nil`.
  - service (String.t): The canonical service name of the peer.

  NOTE: different systems may have different service naming schemes. Defaults to `nil`.
