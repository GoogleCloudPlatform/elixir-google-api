defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.ExponentialBuckets do
  @moduledoc """
  Describing buckets with exponentially growing width.

  ## Attributes

  - growthFactor (float()): The i'th exponential bucket covers the interval
  [scale * growth_factor^(i-1), scale * growth_factor^i)
  where i ranges from 1 to num_finite_buckets inclusive.
  Must be larger than 1.0. Defaults to `nil`.
  - numFiniteBuckets (integer()): The number of finite buckets. With the underflow and overflow buckets,
  the total number of buckets is `num_finite_buckets` + 2.
  See comments on `bucket_options` for details. Defaults to `nil`.
  - scale (float()): The i'th exponential bucket covers the interval
  [scale * growth_factor^(i-1), scale * growth_factor^i)
  where i ranges from 1 to num_finite_buckets inclusive.
  Must be > 0. Defaults to `nil`.
