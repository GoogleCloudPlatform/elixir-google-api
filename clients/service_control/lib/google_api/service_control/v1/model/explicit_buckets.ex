  Describing buckets with arbitrary user-provided width.

  ## Attributes

  - bounds ([float()]): &#39;bound&#39; is a list of strictly increasing boundaries between buckets. Note that a list of length N-1 defines N buckets because of fenceposting. See comments on &#x60;bucket_options&#x60; for details.  The i&#39;th finite bucket covers the interval   [bound[i-1], bound[i]) where i ranges from 1 to bound_size() - 1. Note that there are no finite buckets at all if &#39;bound&#39; only contains a single element; in that special case the single bound defines the boundary between the underflow and overflow buckets.  bucket number                   lower bound    upper bound  i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 (underflow)              -inf           bound[i]  0 &lt; i &lt; bound_size()            bound[i-1]     bound[i]  i &#x3D;&#x3D; bound_size() (overflow)    bound[i-1]     +inf Defaults to: `null`.
