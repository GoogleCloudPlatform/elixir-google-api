defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.AuditLog do
  @moduledoc """
  Common audit log format for Google Cloud Platform API operations.  

  ## Attributes

  - authenticationInfo (AuthenticationInfo): Authentication information. Defaults to: `null`.
  - authorizationInfo (List[AuthorizationInfo]): Authorization information. If there are multiple resources or permissions involved, then there is one AuthorizationInfo element for each {resource, permission} tuple. Defaults to: `null`.
  - methodName (String): The name of the service method or operation. For API calls, this should be the name of the API method. For example,      \&quot;google.datastore.v1.Datastore.RunQuery\&quot;     \&quot;google.logging.v1.LoggingService.DeleteLog\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - numResponseItems (String): The number of items returned from a List or Query API method, if applicable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - request (Object): The operation request. This may not include all request parameters, such as those that are too large, privacy-sensitive, or duplicated elsewhere in the log record. It should never include user-generated data, such as file contents. When the JSON object represented here has a proto equivalent, the proto name will be indicated in the &#x60;@type&#x60; property. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestMetadata (RequestMetadata): Metadata about the operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resourceName (String): The resource or collection that is the target of the operation. The name is a scheme-less URI, not including the API service name. For example:      \&quot;shelves/SHELF_ID/books\&quot;     \&quot;shelves/SHELF_ID/books/BOOK_ID\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - response (Object): The operation response. This may not include all response elements, such as those that are too large, privacy-sensitive, or duplicated elsewhere in the log record. It should never include user-generated data, such as file contents. When the JSON object represented here has a proto equivalent, the proto name will be indicated in the &#x60;@type&#x60; property. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceData (Object): Other service-specific data about the request, response, and other activities. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceName (String): The name of the API service performing the operation. For example, &#x60;\&quot;datastore.googleapis.com\&quot;&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (Status): The status of the overall operation. Defaults to: `null`.
