defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.Resource do
  @moduledoc """
  This message defines core attributes for a resource. A resource is an addressable (named) entity provided by the destination service. For example, a file stored on a network storage service.

  ## Attributes

  - labels (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): The labels or tags on the resource, such as AWS resource tags and Kubernetes resource labels. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The stable identifier (name) of a resource on the &#x60;service&#x60;. A resource can be logically identified as \&quot;//{resource.service}/{resource.name}\&quot;. The differences between a resource name and a URI are:  *   Resource name is a logical identifier, independent of network     protocol and API version. For example,     &#x60;//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/123/topics/news-feed&#x60;. *   URI often includes protocol and version information, so it can     be used directly by applications. For example,     &#x60;https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/123/topics/news-feed&#x60;.  See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names for details. Defaults to: `null`.
  - service (String.t): The name of the service that this resource belongs to, such as &#x60;pubsub.googleapis.com&#x60;. The service may be different from the DNS hostname that actually serves the request. Defaults to: `null`.
  - type (String.t): The type of the resource. The scheme is platform-specific because different platforms define their resources differently. Defaults to: `null`.
