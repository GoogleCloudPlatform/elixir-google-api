defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceControl.V1.Model.ReportRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Request message for the Report method.

  ## Attributes

  - operations ([Operation]): Operations to be reported.  Typically the service should report one operation per request. Putting multiple operations into a single request is allowed, but should be used only when multiple operations are natually available at the time of the report.  If multiple operations are in a single request, the total request size should be no larger than 1MB. See ReportResponse.report_errors for partial failure behavior. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceConfigId (String.t): Specifies which version of service config should be used to process the request.  If unspecified or no matching version can be found, the latest one will be used. Defaults to: `null`.
