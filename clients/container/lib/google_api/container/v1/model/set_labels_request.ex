defmodule GoogleApi.Container.V1.Model.SetLabelsRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  SetLabelsRequest sets the Google Cloud Platform labels on a Google Container Engine cluster, which will in turn set them for Google Compute Engine resources used by that cluster

  ## Attributes

  - labelFingerprint (String): The fingerprint of the previous set of labels for this resource, used to detect conflicts. The fingerprint is initially generated by Container Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash when updating or changing labels. Make a &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; request to the resource to get the latest fingerprint. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resourceLabels (Map[String, String]): The labels to set for that cluster. Defaults to: `null`.
