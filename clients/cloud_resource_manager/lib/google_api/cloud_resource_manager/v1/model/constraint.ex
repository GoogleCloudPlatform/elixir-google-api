defmodule GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.Constraint do
  @moduledoc """
  A &#x60;Constraint&#x60; describes a way in which a resource&#39;s configuration can be restricted. For example, it controls which cloud services can be activated across an organization, or whether a Compute Engine instance can have serial port connections established. &#x60;Constraints&#x60; can be configured by the organization&#39;s policy adminstrator to fit the needs of the organzation by setting Policies for &#x60;Constraints&#x60; at different locations in the organization&#39;s resource hierarchy. Policies are inherited down the resource hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden. For details about the inheritance rules please read about Policies.  &#x60;Constraints&#x60; have a default behavior determined by the &#x60;constraint_default&#x60; field, which is the enforcement behavior that is used in the absence of a &#x60;Policy&#x60; being defined or inherited for the resource in question.

  ## Attributes

  - booleanConstraint (BooleanConstraint): Defines this constraint as being a BooleanConstraint. Defaults to: `null`.
  - constraintDefault (String.t): The evaluation behavior of this constraint in the absense of &#39;Policy&#39;. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [CONSTRAINT_DEFAULT_UNSPECIFIED, ALLOW, DENY]
  - description (String.t): Detailed description of what this &#x60;Constraint&#x60; controls as well as how and where it is enforced.  Mutable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - displayName (String.t): The human readable name.  Mutable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - listConstraint (ListConstraint): Defines this constraint as being a ListConstraint. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Immutable value, required to globally be unique. For example, &#x60;constraints/serviceuser.services&#x60; Defaults to: `null`.
  - version (integer()): Version of the &#x60;Constraint&#x60;. Default version is 0; Defaults to: `null`.
