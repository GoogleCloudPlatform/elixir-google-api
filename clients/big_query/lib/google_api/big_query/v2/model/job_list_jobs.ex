  ## Attributes

  - configuration (JobConfiguration): [Full-projection-only] Specifies the job configuration. Defaults to: `null`.
  - errorResult (ErrorProto): A result object that will be present only if the job has failed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Unique opaque ID of the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - jobReference (JobReference): Job reference uniquely identifying the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): The resource type. Defaults to: `null`.
  - state (String.t): Running state of the job. When the state is DONE, errorResult can be checked to determine whether the job succeeded or failed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - statistics (JobStatistics): [Output-only] Information about the job, including starting time and ending time of the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (JobStatus): [Full-projection-only] Describes the state of the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - user_email (String.t): [Full-projection-only] Email address of the user who ran the job. Defaults to: `null`.
