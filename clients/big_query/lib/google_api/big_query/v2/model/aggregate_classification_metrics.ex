defmodule GoogleApi.BigQuery.V2.Model.AggregateClassificationMetrics do
  @moduledoc """
  Aggregate metrics for classification models. For multi-class models, the metrics are either macro-averaged: metrics are calculated for each label and then an unweighted average is taken of those values or micro-averaged: the metric is calculated globally by counting the total number of correctly predicted rows.

  ## Attributes

  - accuracy (float()): Accuracy is the fraction of predictions given the correct label. For multiclass this is a micro-averaged metric. Defaults to: `null`.
  - f1Score (float()): The F1 score is an average of recall and precision. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to: `null`.
  - logLoss (float()): Logarithmic Loss. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to: `null`.
  - precision (float()): Precision is the fraction of actual positive predictions that had positive actual labels. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric treating each class as a binary classifier. Defaults to: `null`.
  - recall (float()): Recall is the fraction of actual positive labels that were given a positive prediction. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rocAuc (float()): Area Under a ROC Curve. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to: `null`.
  - threshold (float()): Threshold at which the metrics are computed. For binary classification models this is the positive class threshold. For multi-class classfication models this is the confidence threshold. Defaults to: `null`.
