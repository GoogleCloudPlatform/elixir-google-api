defmodule GoogleApi.BigQuery.V2.Model.AggregateClassificationMetrics do
  @moduledoc """
  Aggregate metrics for classification/classifier models. For multi-class
  models, the metrics are either macro-averaged or micro-averaged. When
  macro-averaged, the metrics are calculated for each label and then an
  unweighted average is taken of those values. When micro-averaged, the
  metric is calculated globally by counting the total number of correctly
  predicted rows.

  ## Attributes

  - accuracy (float()): Accuracy is the fraction of predictions given the correct label. For
  multiclass this is a micro-averaged metric. Defaults to `nil`.
  - f1Score (float()): The F1 score is an average of recall and precision. For multiclass
  this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to `nil`.
  - logLoss (float()): Logarithmic Loss. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to `nil`.
  - precision (float()): Precision is the fraction of actual positive predictions that had
  positive actual labels. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged
  metric treating each class as a binary classifier. Defaults to `nil`.
  - recall (float()): Recall is the fraction of actual positive labels that were given a
  positive prediction. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric. Defaults to `nil`.
  - rocAuc (float()): Area Under a ROC Curve. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged
  metric. Defaults to `nil`.
  - threshold (float()): Threshold at which the metrics are computed. For binary
  classification models this is the positive class threshold.
  For multi-class classfication models this is the confidence
  threshold. Defaults to `nil`.
