  ## Attributes

  - creationTime (String.t): [Output-only] Creation time of this job, in milliseconds since the epoch. This field will be present on all jobs. Defaults to: `null`.
  - endTime (String.t): [Output-only] End time of this job, in milliseconds since the epoch. This field will be present whenever a job is in the DONE state. Defaults to: `null`.
  - extract (JobStatistics4): [Output-only] Statistics for an extract job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - load (JobStatistics3): [Output-only] Statistics for a load job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - query (JobStatistics2): [Output-only] Statistics for a query job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String.t): [Output-only] Start time of this job, in milliseconds since the epoch. This field will be present when the job transitions from the PENDING state to either RUNNING or DONE. Defaults to: `null`.
  - totalBytesProcessed (String.t): [Output-only] [Deprecated] Use the bytes processed in the query statistics instead. Defaults to: `null`.
