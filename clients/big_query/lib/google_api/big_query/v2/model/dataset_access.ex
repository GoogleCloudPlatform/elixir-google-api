  - specialGroup (String.t): [Pick one] A special group to grant access to. Possible values include: projectOwners: Owners of the enclosing project. projectReaders: Readers of the enclosing project. projectWriters: Writers of the enclosing project. allAuthenticatedUsers: All authenticated BigQuery users. Maps to similarly-named IAM members. Defaults to: `null`.
  - userByEmail (String.t): [Pick one] An email address of a user to grant access to. For example: fred@example.com. Maps to IAM policy member \&quot;user:EMAIL\&quot; or \&quot;serviceAccount:EMAIL\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
