defmodule GoogleApi.ToolResults.V1beta3.Model.History do
  @moduledoc """
  A History represents a sorted list of Executions ordered by the start_timestamp_millis field (descending). It can be used to group all the Executions of a continuous build.  Note that the ordering only operates on one-dimension. If a repository has multiple branches, it means that multiple histories will need to be used in order to order Executions per branch.
