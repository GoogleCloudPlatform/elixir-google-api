defmodule GoogleApi.ToolResults.V1beta3.Model.ListStepThumbnailsResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  A response containing the thumbnails in a step.

  ## Attributes

  - nextPageToken (String): A continuation token to resume the query at the next item.  If set, indicates that there are more thumbnails to read, by calling list again with this value in the page_token field. Defaults to: `null`.
  - thumbnails (List[Image]): A list of image data.  Images are returned in a deterministic order; they are ordered by these factors, in order of importance: * First, by their associated test case. Images without a test case are considered greater than images with one. * Second, by their creation time. Images without a creation time are greater than images with one. * Third, by the order in which they were added to the step (by calls to CreateStep or UpdateStep). Defaults to: `null`.
