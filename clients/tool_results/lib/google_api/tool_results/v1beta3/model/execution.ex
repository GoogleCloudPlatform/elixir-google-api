  An Execution represents a collection of Steps. For instance, it could represent: - a mobile test executed across a range of device configurations - a jenkins job with a build step followed by a test step  The maximum size of an execution message is 1 MiB.  An Execution can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which point it becomes immutable.
