  @moduledoc """
  A summary of a test suite result either parsed from XML or uploaded directly by a user.  Note: the API related comments are for StepService only. This message is also being used in ExecutionService in a read only mode for the corresponding step.

  ## Attributes

  - errorCount (Integer): Number of test cases in error, typically set by the service by parsing the xml_source.  - In create/response: always set - In update request: never Defaults to: `null`.
  - failureCount (Integer): Number of failed test cases, typically set by the service by parsing the xml_source. May also be set by the user.  - In create/response: always set - In update request: never Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The name of the test suite.  - In create/response: always set - In update request: never Defaults to: `null`.
  - skippedCount (Integer): Number of test cases not run, typically set by the service by parsing the xml_source.  - In create/response: always set - In update request: never Defaults to: `null`.
  - totalCount (Integer): Number of test cases, typically set by the service by parsing the xml_source.  - In create/response: always set - In update request: never Defaults to: `null`.
  - xmlSource (FileReference): If this test suite was parsed from XML, this is the URI where the original XML file is stored.  Note: Multiple test suites can share the same xml_source  Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if the uri format is not supported.  - In create/response: optional - In update request: never Defaults to: `null`.
