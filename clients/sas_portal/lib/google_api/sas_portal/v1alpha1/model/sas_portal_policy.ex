defmodule GoogleApi.SASPortal.V1alpha1.Model.SasPortalPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines an access control policy to the resources.

  ## Attributes

  *   `assignments` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.SASPortal.V1alpha1.Model.SasPortalAssignment.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - 
  *   `etag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The [etag] is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the [etag] in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An [etag] is returned in the response to [GetPolicy], and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to [SetPolicy] to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. If no [etag] is provided in the call to [SetPolicy], then the existing policy is overwritten blindly.
