defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceUser.V1.Model.Quota do
  @moduledoc """
  Quota configuration helps to achieve fairness and budgeting in service usage.  The quota configuration works this way: - The service configuration defines a set of metrics. - For API calls, the quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with   corresponding costs. - The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for   quota checks at runtime.  An example quota configuration in yaml format:     quota:       - name: apiWriteQpsPerProject        metric: library.googleapis.com/write_calls        unit: \&quot;1/min/{project}\&quot;  # rate limit for consumer projects        values:          STANDARD: 10000        # The metric rules bind all methods to the read_calls metric,      # except for the UpdateBook and DeleteBook methods. These two methods      # are mapped to the write_calls metric, with the UpdateBook method      # consuming at twice rate as the DeleteBook method.      metric_rules:      - selector: \&quot;*\&quot;        metric_costs:          library.googleapis.com/read_calls: 1      - selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.UpdateBook        metric_costs:          library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 2      - selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.DeleteBook        metric_costs:          library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 1   Corresponding Metric definition:       metrics:      - name: library.googleapis.com/read_calls        display_name: Read requests        metric_kind: DELTA        value_type: INT64       - name: library.googleapis.com/write_calls        display_name: Write requests        metric_kind: DELTA        value_type: INT64
