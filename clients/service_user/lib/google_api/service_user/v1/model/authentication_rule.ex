defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceUser.V1.Model.AuthenticationRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Authentication rules for the service.  By default, if a method has any authentication requirements, every request must include a valid credential matching one of the requirements. It&#39;s an error to include more than one kind of credential in a single request.  If a method doesn&#39;t have any auth requirements, request credentials will be ignored.

  ## Attributes

  - allowWithoutCredential (Boolean): Whether to allow requests without a credential. The credential can be an OAuth token, Google cookies (first-party auth) or EndUserCreds.  For requests without credentials, if the service control environment is specified, each incoming request **must** be associated with a service consumer. This can be done by passing an API key that belongs to a consumer project. Defaults to: `null`.
  - customAuth (CustomAuthRequirements): Configuration for custom authentication. Defaults to: `null`.
  - oauth (OAuthRequirements): The requirements for OAuth credentials. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requirements (List[AuthRequirement]): Requirements for additional authentication providers. Defaults to: `null`.
  - selector (String): Selects the methods to which this rule applies.  Refer to selector for syntax details. Defaults to: `null`.
