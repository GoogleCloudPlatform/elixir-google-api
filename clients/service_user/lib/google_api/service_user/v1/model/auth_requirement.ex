  @moduledoc """
  User-defined authentication requirements, including support for [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32).

  ## Attributes

  - audiences (String): NOTE: This will be deprecated soon, once AuthProvider.audiences is implemented and accepted in all the runtime components.  The list of JWT [audiences](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-4.1.3). that are allowed to access. A JWT containing any of these audiences will be accepted. When this setting is absent, only JWTs with audience \&quot;https://Service_name/API_name\&quot; will be accepted. For example, if no audiences are in the setting, LibraryService API will only accept JWTs with the following audience \&quot;https://library-example.googleapis.com/google.example.library.v1.LibraryService\&quot;.  Example:      audiences: bookstore_android.apps.googleusercontent.com,                bookstore_web.apps.googleusercontent.com Defaults to: `null`.
  - providerId (String): id from authentication provider.  Example:      provider_id: bookstore_auth Defaults to: `null`.
