defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceUser.V1.Model.MediaUpload do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines the Media configuration for a service in case of an upload. Use this only for Scotty Requests. Do not use this for media support using Bytestream, add instead [][google.bytestream.RestByteStream] as an API to your configuration for Bytestream methods.
