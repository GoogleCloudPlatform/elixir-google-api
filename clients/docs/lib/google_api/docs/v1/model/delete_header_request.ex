  Deletes a Header from the document.

  *   `headerId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The id of the header to delete. If this header is defined on
      DocumentStyle, the reference to
      this header is removed, resulting in no header of that type for
      the first section of the document. If this header is defined on a
      SectionStyle, the reference to this
      header is removed and the header of that type is now continued from
      the previous section.
