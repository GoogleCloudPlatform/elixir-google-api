  Deletes a Footer from the document.

  *   `footerId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The id of the footer to delete. If this footer is defined on
      DocumentStyle, the reference to
      this footer is removed, resulting in no footer of that type for
      the first section of the document. If this footer is defined on a
      SectionStyle, the reference to this
      footer is removed and the footer of that type is now continued from
      the previous section.
