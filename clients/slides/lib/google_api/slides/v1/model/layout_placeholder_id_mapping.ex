defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.LayoutPlaceholderIdMapping do
  @moduledoc """
  The user-specified ID mapping for a placeholder that will be created on a slide from a specified layout.

  ## Attributes

  - layoutPlaceholder (Placeholder): The placeholder on a layout that will be applied to a slide. Only type and index are needed. For example, a predefined &#x60;TITLE_AND_BODY&#x60; layout may usually have a TITLE placeholder with index 0 and a BODY placeholder with index 0. Defaults to: `null`.
  - layoutPlaceholderObjectId (String.t): The object ID of the placeholder on a layout that will be applied to a slide. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectId (String.t): A user-supplied object ID for the placeholder identified above that to be created onto a slide.  If you specify an ID, it must be unique among all pages and page elements in the presentation. The ID must start with an alphanumeric character or an underscore (matches regex &#x60;[a-zA-Z0-9_]&#x60;); remaining characters may include those as well as a hyphen or colon (matches regex &#x60;[a-zA-Z0-9_-:]&#x60;). The length of the ID must not be less than 5 or greater than 50.  If you don&#39;t specify an ID, a unique one is generated. Defaults to: `null`.
