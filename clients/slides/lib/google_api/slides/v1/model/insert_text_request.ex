defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.InsertTextRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Inserts text into a shape or a table cell.

  ## Attributes

  - cellLocation (TableCellLocation): The optional table cell location if the text is to be inserted into a table cell. If present, the object_id must refer to a table. Defaults to: `null`.
  - insertionIndex (Integer): The index where the text will be inserted, in Unicode code units, based on TextElement indexes.  The index is zero-based and is computed from the start of the string. The index may be adjusted to prevent insertions inside Unicode grapheme clusters. In these cases, the text will be inserted immediately after the grapheme cluster. Defaults to: `null`.
  - objectId (String): The object ID of the shape or table where the text will be inserted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - text (String): The text to be inserted.  Inserting a newline character will implicitly create a new ParagraphMarker at that index. The paragraph style of the new paragraph will be copied from the paragraph at the current insertion index, including lists and bullets.  Text styles for inserted text will be determined automatically, generally preserving the styling of neighboring text. In most cases, the text will be added to the TextRun that exists at the insertion index.  Some control characters (U+0000-U+0008, U+000C-U+001F) and characters from the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane Private Use Area (U+E000-U+F8FF) will be stripped out of the inserted text. Defaults to: `null`.
