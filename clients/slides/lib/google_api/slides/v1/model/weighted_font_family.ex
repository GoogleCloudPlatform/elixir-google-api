defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.WeightedFontFamily do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a font family and weight used to style a TextRun.

  ## Attributes

  - fontFamily (String.t): The font family of the text.  The font family can be any font from the Font menu in Slides or from [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/). If the font name is unrecognized, the text is rendered in &#x60;Arial&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - weight (integer()): The rendered weight of the text. This field can have any value that is a multiple of &#x60;100&#x60; between &#x60;100&#x60; and &#x60;900&#x60;, inclusive. This range corresponds to the numerical values described in the CSS 2.1 Specification, [section 15.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness), with non-numerical values disallowed. Weights greater than or equal to &#x60;700&#x60; are considered bold, and weights less than &#x60;700&#x60;are not bold. The default value is &#x60;400&#x60; (\&quot;normal\&quot;). Defaults to: `null`.
