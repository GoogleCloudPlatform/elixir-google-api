defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.CallSet do
  @moduledoc """
  A call set is a collection of variant calls, typically for one sample. It belongs to a variant set.

  ## Attributes

  - info (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; [ErrorUnknown]}): A map of additional call set information. This must be of the form map&lt;string, string[]&gt; (string key mapping to a list of string values). Defaults to: `null`.
  - created (String.t): The date this call set was created in milliseconds from the epoch. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): The server-generated call set ID, unique across all call sets. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The call set name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sampleId (String.t): The sample ID this call set corresponds to. Defaults to: `null`.
  - variantSetIds ([String.t]): The IDs of the variant sets this call set belongs to. This field must have exactly length one, as a call set belongs to a single variant set. This field is repeated for compatibility with the [GA4GH 0.5.1 API](https://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/blob/v0.5.1/src/main/resources/avro/variants.avdl#L76). Defaults to: `null`.
