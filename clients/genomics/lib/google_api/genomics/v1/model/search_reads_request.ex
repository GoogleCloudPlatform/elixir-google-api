defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.SearchReadsRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  The read search request.

  ## Attributes

  - end (String.t): The end position of the range on the reference, 0-based exclusive. If specified, &#x60;referenceName&#x60; must also be specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pageSize (integer()): The maximum number of results to return in a single page. If unspecified, defaults to 256. The maximum value is 2048. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pageToken (String.t): The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of &#x60;nextPageToken&#x60; from the previous response. Defaults to: `null`.
  - readGroupIds ([String.t]): The IDs of the read groups within which to search for reads. All specified read groups must belong to the same read group sets. Must specify one of &#x60;readGroupSetIds&#x60; or &#x60;readGroupIds&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - readGroupSetIds ([String.t]): The IDs of the read groups sets within which to search for reads. All specified read group sets must be aligned against a common set of reference sequences; this defines the genomic coordinates for the query. Must specify one of &#x60;readGroupSetIds&#x60; or &#x60;readGroupIds&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceName (String.t): The reference sequence name, for example &#x60;chr1&#x60;, &#x60;1&#x60;, or &#x60;chrX&#x60;. If set to &#x60;*&#x60;, only unmapped reads are returned. If unspecified, all reads (mapped and unmapped) are returned. Defaults to: `null`.
  - start (String.t): The start position of the range on the reference, 0-based inclusive. If specified, &#x60;referenceName&#x60; must also be specified. Defaults to: `null`.
