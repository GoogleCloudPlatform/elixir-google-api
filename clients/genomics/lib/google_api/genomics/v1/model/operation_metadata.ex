defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.OperationMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Metadata describing an Operation.

  ## Attributes

  - clientId (String): This field is deprecated. Use &#x60;labels&#x60; instead. Optionally provided by the caller when submitting the request that creates the operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createTime (String): The time at which the job was submitted to the Genomics service. Defaults to: `null`.
  - endTime (String): The time at which the job stopped running. Defaults to: `null`.
  - events (List[OperationEvent]): Optional event messages that were generated during the job&#39;s execution. This also contains any warnings that were generated during import or export. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labels (Map[String, String]): Optionally provided by the caller when submitting the request that creates the operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - projectId (String): The Google Cloud Project in which the job is scoped. Defaults to: `null`.
  - request (Object): The original request that started the operation. Note that this will be in current version of the API. If the operation was started with v1beta2 API and a GetOperation is performed on v1 API, a v1 request will be returned. Defaults to: `null`.
  - runtimeMetadata (Object): Runtime metadata on this Operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String): The time at which the job began to run. Defaults to: `null`.
