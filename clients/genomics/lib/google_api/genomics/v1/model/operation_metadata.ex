defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.OperationMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Metadata describing an Operation.

  ## Attributes

  - clientId (String.t): This field is deprecated. Use `labels` instead. Optionally provided by the
  caller when submitting the request that creates the operation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the job was submitted to the Genomics service. Defaults to `nil`.
  - endTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the job stopped running. Defaults to `nil`.
  - events (list(GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.OperationEvent.t)): Optional event messages that were generated during the job's execution.
  This also contains any warnings that were generated during import
  or export. Defaults to `nil`.
  - labels (map()): Optionally provided by the caller when submitting the request that creates
  the operation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - projectId (String.t): The Google Cloud Project in which the job is scoped. Defaults to `nil`.
  - request (map()): The original request that started the operation. Note that this will be in
  current version of the API. If the operation was started with v1beta2 API
  and a GetOperation is performed on v1 API, a v1 request will be returned. Defaults to `nil`.
  - runtimeMetadata (map()): Runtime metadata on this Operation. Defaults to `nil`.
  - startTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the job began to run. Defaults to `nil`.
