  The variant search request.

  ## Attributes

  - callSetIds ([String.t]): Only return variant calls which belong to call sets with these ids. Leaving this blank returns all variant calls. If a variant has no calls belonging to any of these call sets, it won&#39;t be returned at all. Defaults to: `null`.
  - end (String.t): The end of the window, 0-based exclusive. If unspecified or 0, defaults to the length of the reference. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxCalls (integer()): The maximum number of calls to return in a single page. Note that this limit may be exceeded in the event that a matching variant contains more calls than the requested maximum. If unspecified, defaults to 5000. The maximum value is 10000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pageSize (integer()): The maximum number of variants to return in a single page. If unspecified, defaults to 5000. The maximum value is 10000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pageToken (String.t): The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of &#x60;nextPageToken&#x60; from the previous response. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceName (String.t): Required. Only return variants in this reference sequence. Defaults to: `null`.
  - start (String.t): The beginning of the window (0-based, inclusive) for which overlapping variants should be returned. If unspecified, defaults to 0. Defaults to: `null`.
  - variantName (String.t): Only return variants which have exactly this name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - variantSetIds ([String.t]): At most one variant set ID must be provided. Only variants from this variant set will be returned. If omitted, a call set id must be included in the request. Defaults to: `null`.
