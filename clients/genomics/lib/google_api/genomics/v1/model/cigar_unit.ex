  @moduledoc """
  A single CIGAR operation.

  ## Attributes

  - operation (String):  Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [OPERATION_UNSPECIFIED, ALIGNMENT_MATCH, INSERT, DELETE, SKIP, CLIP_SOFT, CLIP_HARD, PAD, SEQUENCE_MATCH, SEQUENCE_MISMATCH]
  - operationLength (String): The number of genomic bases that the operation runs for. Required. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceSequence (String): &#x60;referenceSequence&#x60; is only used at mismatches (&#x60;SEQUENCE_MISMATCH&#x60;) and deletions (&#x60;DELETE&#x60;). Filling this field replaces SAM&#39;s MD tag. If the relevant information is not available, this field is unset. Defaults to: `null`.
