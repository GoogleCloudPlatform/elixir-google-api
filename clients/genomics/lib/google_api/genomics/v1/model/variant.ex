defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.Variant do
  @moduledoc """
  A variant represents a change in DNA sequence relative to a reference sequence. For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion. Variants belong to a variant set.  For more genomics resource definitions, see [Fundamentals of Google Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics)  Each of the calls on a variant represent a determination of genotype with respect to that variant. For example, a call might assign probability of 0.32 to the occurrence of a SNP named rs1234 in a sample named NA12345. A call belongs to a call set, which contains related calls typically from one sample.
