defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.Variant do
  @moduledoc """
  A variant represents a change in DNA sequence relative to a reference sequence. For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion. Variants belong to a variant set.  Each of the calls on a variant represent a determination of genotype with respect to that variant. For example, a call might assign probability of 0.32 to the occurrence of a SNP named rs1234 in a sample named NA12345. A call belongs to a call set, which contains related calls typically from one sample.

  ## Attributes

  - info (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; [ErrorUnknown]}): A map of additional variant information. This must be of the form map&lt;string, string[]&gt; (string key mapping to a list of string values). Defaults to: `null`.
  - alternateBases ([String.t]): The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Defaults to: `null`.
  - calls ([VariantCall]): The variant calls for this particular variant. Each one represents the determination of genotype with respect to this variant. Defaults to: `null`.
  - created (String.t): The date this variant was created, in milliseconds from the epoch. Defaults to: `null`.
  - end (String.t): The end position (0-based) of this variant. This corresponds to the first base after the last base in the reference allele. So, the length of the reference allele is (end - start). This is useful for variants that don&#39;t explicitly give alternate bases, for example large deletions. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filter ([String.t]): A list of filters (normally quality filters) this variant has failed. &#x60;PASS&#x60; indicates this variant has passed all filters. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): The server-generated variant ID, unique across all variants. Defaults to: `null`.
  - names ([String.t]): Names for the variant, for example a RefSNP ID. Defaults to: `null`.
  - quality (float()): A measure of how likely this variant is to be real. A higher value is better. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceBases (String.t): The reference bases for this variant. They start at the given position. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceName (String.t): The reference on which this variant occurs. (such as &#x60;chr20&#x60; or &#x60;X&#x60;) Defaults to: `null`.
  - start (String.t): The position at which this variant occurs (0-based). This corresponds to the first base of the string of reference bases. Defaults to: `null`.
  - variantSetId (String.t): The ID of the variant set this variant belongs to. Defaults to: `null`.
