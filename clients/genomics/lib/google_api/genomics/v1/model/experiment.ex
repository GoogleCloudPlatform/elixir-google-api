  ## Attributes

  - instrumentModel (String): The instrument model used as part of this experiment. This maps to sequencing technology in the SAM spec. Defaults to: `null`.
  - libraryId (String): A client-supplied library identifier; a library is a collection of DNA fragments which have been prepared for sequencing from a sample. This field is important for quality control as error or bias can be introduced during sample preparation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - platformUnit (String): The platform unit used as part of this experiment, for example flowcell-barcode.lane for Illumina or slide for SOLiD. Corresponds to the @RG PU field in the SAM spec. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sequencingCenter (String): The sequencing center used as part of this experiment. Defaults to: `null`.
