  ## Attributes

  - bucketWidth (String.t): The length of each coverage bucket in base pairs. Note that buckets at the end of a reference sequence may be shorter. This value is omitted if the bucket width is infinity (the default behaviour, with no range or &#x60;targetBucketWidth&#x60;). Defaults to: `null`.
  - coverageBuckets ([CoverageBucket]): The coverage buckets. The list of buckets is sparse; a bucket with 0 overlapping reads is not returned. A bucket never crosses more than one reference sequence. Each bucket has width &#x60;bucketWidth&#x60;, unless its end is the end of the reference sequence. Defaults to: `null`.
  - nextPageToken (String.t): The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of results. This field will be empty if there aren&#39;t any additional results. Defaults to: `null`.
