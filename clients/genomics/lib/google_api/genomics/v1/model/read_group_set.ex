defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.ReadGroupSet do
  @moduledoc """
  A read group set is a logical collection of read groups, which are collections of reads produced by a sequencer. A read group set typically models reads corresponding to one sample, sequenced one way, and aligned one way.  * A read group set belongs to one dataset. * A read group belongs to one read group set. * A read belongs to one read group.

  ## Attributes

  - info (Map[String, List[ErrorUnknown]]): A map of additional read group set information. Defaults to: `null`.
  - datasetId (String): The dataset to which this read group set belongs. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filename (String): The filename of the original source file for this read group set, if any. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String): The server-generated read group set ID, unique for all read group sets. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The read group set name. By default this will be initialized to the sample name of the sequenced data contained in this set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - readGroups (List[ReadGroup]): The read groups in this set. There are typically 1-10 read groups in a read group set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceSetId (String): The reference set to which the reads in this read group set are aligned. Defaults to: `null`.
