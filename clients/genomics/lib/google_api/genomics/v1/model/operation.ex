defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.Operation do
  @moduledoc """
  This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  ## Attributes

  - done (Boolean): If the value is &#x60;false&#x60;, it means the operation is still in progress. If &#x60;true&#x60;, the operation is completed, and either &#x60;error&#x60; or &#x60;response&#x60; is available. Defaults to: `null`.
  - error (Status): The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - metadata (Object): An OperationMetadata object. This will always be returned with the Operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. For example&amp;#58; &#x60;operations/CJHU7Oi_ChDrveSpBRjfuL-qzoWAgEw&#x60; Defaults to: `null`.
  - response (Object): If importing ReadGroupSets, an ImportReadGroupSetsResponse is returned. If importing Variants, an ImportVariantsResponse is returned. For pipelines and exports, an empty response is returned. Defaults to: `null`.
