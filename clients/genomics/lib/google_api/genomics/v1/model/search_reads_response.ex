  @moduledoc """
  The read search response.

  ## Attributes

  - alignments (List[Read]): The list of matching alignments sorted by mapped genomic coordinate, if any, ascending in position within the same reference. Unmapped reads, which have no position, are returned contiguously and are sorted in ascending lexicographic order by fragment name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - nextPageToken (String): The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of results. This field will be empty if there aren&#39;t any additional results. Defaults to: `null`.
