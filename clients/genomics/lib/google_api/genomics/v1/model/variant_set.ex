defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.VariantSet do
  @moduledoc """
  A variant set is a collection of call sets and variants. It contains summary statistics of those contents. A variant set belongs to a dataset.  For more genomics resource definitions, see [Fundamentals of Google Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics)

  ## Attributes

  - datasetId (String): The dataset to which this variant set belongs. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String): A textual description of this variant set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String): The server-generated variant set ID, unique across all variant sets. Defaults to: `null`.
  - metadata (List[VariantSetMetadata]): The metadata associated with this variant set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): User-specified, mutable name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceBounds (List[ReferenceBound]): A list of all references used by the variants in a variant set with associated coordinate upper bounds for each one. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceSetId (String): The reference set to which the variant set is mapped. The reference set describes the alignment provenance of the variant set, while the &#x60;referenceBounds&#x60; describe the shape of the actual variant data. The reference set&#39;s reference names are a superset of those found in the &#x60;referenceBounds&#x60;.  For example, given a variant set that is mapped to the GRCh38 reference set and contains a single variant on reference &#39;X&#39;, &#x60;referenceBounds&#x60; would contain only an entry for &#39;X&#39;, while the associated reference set enumerates all possible references: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;X&#39;, &#39;Y&#39;, &#39;MT&#39;, etc. Defaults to: `null`.
