defmodule GoogleApi.CivicInfo.V2.Model.Office do
  @moduledoc """
  Information about an Office held by one or more Officials.

  ## Attributes

  - divisionId (String.t): The OCD ID of the division with which this office is associated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - levels ([String.t]): The levels of government of which this office is part. There may be more than one in cases where a jurisdiction effectively acts at two different levels of government; for example, the mayor of the District of Columbia acts at \&quot;locality\&quot; level, but also effectively at both \&quot;administrative-area-2\&quot; and \&quot;administrative-area-1\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The human-readable name of the office. Defaults to: `null`.
  - officialIndices ([integer()]): List of indices in the officials array of people who presently hold this office. Defaults to: `null`.
  - roles ([String.t]): The roles which this office fulfills. Roles are not meant to be exhaustive, or to exactly specify the entire set of responsibilities of a given office, but are meant to be rough categories that are useful for general selection from or sorting of a list of offices. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sources ([Source]): A list of sources for this office. If multiple sources are listed, the data has been aggregated from those sources. Defaults to: `null`.
