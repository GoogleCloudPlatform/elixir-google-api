  @moduledoc """
  Represents a political geographic division that matches the requested query.

  ## Attributes

  - aliases (List[String]): Other Open Civic Data identifiers that refer to the same division -- for example, those that refer to other political divisions whose boundaries are defined to be coterminous with this one. For example, ocd-division/country:us/state:wy will include an alias of ocd-division/country:us/state:wy/cd:1, since Wyoming has only one Congressional district. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The name of the division. Defaults to: `null`.
  - ocdId (String): The unique Open Civic Data identifier for this division. Defaults to: `null`.
