defmodule GoogleApi.Datastore.V1.Model.PartitionId do
  @moduledoc """
  A partition ID identifies a grouping of entities. The grouping is always by project and namespace, however the namespace ID may be empty.  A partition ID contains several dimensions: project ID and namespace ID.  Partition dimensions:  - May be &#x60;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;. - Must be valid UTF-8 bytes. - Must have values that match regex &#x60;[A-Za-z\\d\\.\\-_]{1,100}&#x60; If the value of any dimension matches regex &#x60;__.*__&#x60;, the partition is reserved/read-only. A reserved/read-only partition ID is forbidden in certain documented contexts.  Foreign partition IDs (in which the project ID does not match the context project ID ) are discouraged. Reads and writes of foreign partition IDs may fail if the project is not in an active state.

  ## Attributes

  - namespaceId (String): If not empty, the ID of the namespace to which the entities belong. Defaults to: `null`.
  - projectId (String): The ID of the project to which the entities belong. Defaults to: `null`.
