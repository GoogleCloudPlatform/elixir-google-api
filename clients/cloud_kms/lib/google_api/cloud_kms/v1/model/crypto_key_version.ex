  @moduledoc """
  A CryptoKeyVersion represents an individual cryptographic key, and the associated key material.  It can be used for cryptographic operations either directly, or via its parent CryptoKey, in which case the server will choose the appropriate version for the operation.  For security reasons, the raw cryptographic key material represented by a CryptoKeyVersion can never be viewed or exported. It can only be used to encrypt or decrypt data when an authorized user or application invokes Cloud KMS.
