defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.FlowOperationMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  The metadata associated with a long running operation resource.

  ## Attributes

  - cancelState (String): The state of the operation with respect to cancellation. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [RUNNING, UNCANCELLABLE, CANCELLED]
  - deadline (String): Deadline for the flow to complete, to prevent orphaned Operations.  If the flow has not completed by this time, it may be terminated by the engine, or force-failed by Operation lookup.  Note that this is not a hard deadline after which the Flow will definitely be failed, rather it is a deadline after which it is reasonable to suspect a problem and other parts of the system may kill operation to ensure we don&#39;t have orphans. see also: go/prevent-orphaned-operations Defaults to: `null`.
  - flowName (String): The name of the top-level flow corresponding to this operation. Must be equal to the \&quot;name\&quot; field for a FlowName enum. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resourceNames (List[String]): The full name of the resources that this flow is directly associated with. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String): The start time of the operation. Defaults to: `null`.
