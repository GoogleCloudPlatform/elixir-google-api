defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Api do
  @moduledoc """
  Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface.

  Interfaces are also described as "protocol buffer services" in some contexts,
  such as by the "service" keyword in a .proto file, but they are different
  from API Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an interface
  as opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They are also
  sometimes simply referred to as "APIs" in other contexts, such as the name of
  this message itself. See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary for
  detailed terminology.

  ## Attributes

  - methods (list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Method.t)): The methods of this interface, in unspecified order. Defaults to `nil`.
  - mixins (list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Mixin.t)): Included interfaces. See Mixin. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): The fully qualified name of this interface, including package name
  followed by the interface's simple name. Defaults to `nil`.
  - options (list(GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Option.t)): Any metadata attached to the interface. Defaults to `nil`.
  - sourceContext (GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.SourceContext.t): Source context for the protocol buffer service represented by this
  message. Defaults to `nil`.
  - syntax (String.t): The source syntax of the service. Defaults to `nil`.
  - version (String.t): A version string for this interface. If specified, must have the form
  `major-version.minor-version`, as in `1.10`. If the minor version is
  omitted, it defaults to zero. If the entire version field is empty, the
  major version is derived from the package name, as outlined below. If the
  field is not empty, the version in the package name will be verified to be
  consistent with what is provided here.

  The versioning schema uses [semantic
  versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number
  indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive,
  non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users
  what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully
  chosen based on the product plan.

  The major version is also reflected in the package name of the
  interface, which must end in `v<major-version>`, as in
  `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can
  be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for
  experimental, non-GA interfaces.
  Defaults to `nil`.
