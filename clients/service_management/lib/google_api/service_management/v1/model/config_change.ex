defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.ConfigChange do
  @moduledoc """
  Output generated from semantically comparing two versions of a service configuration.  Includes detailed information about a field that have changed with applicable advice about potential consequences for the change, such as backwards-incompatibility.

  ## Attributes

  - advices (List[Advice]): Collection of advice provided for this change, useful for determining the possible impact of this change. Defaults to: `null`.
  - changeType (String): The type for this change, either ADDED, REMOVED, or MODIFIED. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [CHANGE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, ADDED, REMOVED, MODIFIED]
  - element (String): Object hierarchy path to the change, with levels separated by a &#39;.&#39; character. For repeated fields, an applicable unique identifier field is used for the index (usually selector, name, or id). For maps, the term &#39;key&#39; is used. If the field has no unique identifier, the numeric index is used. Examples: - visibility.rules[selector&#x3D;&#x3D;\&quot;google.LibraryService.CreateBook\&quot;].restriction - quota.metric_rules[selector&#x3D;&#x3D;\&quot;google\&quot;].metric_costs[key&#x3D;&#x3D;\&quot;reads\&quot;].value - logging.producer_destinations[0] Defaults to: `null`.
  - newValue (String): Value of the changed object in the new Service configuration, in JSON format. This field will not be populated if ChangeType &#x3D;&#x3D; REMOVED. Defaults to: `null`.
  - oldValue (String): Value of the changed object in the old Service configuration, in JSON format. This field will not be populated if ChangeType &#x3D;&#x3D; ADDED. Defaults to: `null`.
