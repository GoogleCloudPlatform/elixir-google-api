defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceManagement.V1.Model.Rollout do
  @moduledoc """
  A rollout resource that defines how service configuration versions are pushed to control plane systems. Typically, you create a new version of the service config, and then create a Rollout to push the service config.

  ## Attributes

  - createTime (String): Creation time of the rollout. Readonly. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createdBy (String): The user who created the Rollout. Readonly. Defaults to: `null`.
  - deleteServiceStrategy (DeleteServiceStrategy): The strategy associated with a rollout to delete a &#x60;ManagedService&#x60;. Readonly. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rolloutId (String): Optional unique identifier of this Rollout. Only lower case letters, digits  and &#39;-&#39; are allowed.  If not specified by client, the server will generate one. The generated id will have the form of &lt;date&gt;&lt;revision number&gt;, where \&quot;date\&quot; is the create date in ISO 8601 format.  \&quot;revision number\&quot; is a monotonically increasing positive number that is reset every day for each service. An example of the generated rollout_id is &#39;2016-02-16r1&#39; Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceName (String): The name of the service associated with this Rollout. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String): The status of this rollout. Readonly. In case of a failed rollout, the system will automatically rollback to the current Rollout version. Readonly. Defaults to: `null`.
