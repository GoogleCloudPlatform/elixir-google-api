defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V3.Model.ClientEvent do
  @moduledoc """
  An event issued when an end user interacts with the application that
  implements Cloud Talent Solution. Providing this information improves the
  quality of search and recommendation for the API clients, enabling the
  service to perform optimally. The number of events sent must be consistent
  with other calls, such as job searches, issued to the service by the client.

  ## Attributes

  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The timestamp of the event.
  *   `eventId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A unique identifier, generated by the client application. This `event_id`
      is used to establish the relationship between different events
      (see parent_event_id).
  *   `extraInfo` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Extra information about this event. Used for storing information with no
      matching field in event payload, for example, user application specific
      context or details.

      At most 20 keys are supported. The maximum total size of all keys and
      values is 2 KB.
  *   `jobEvent` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Jobs.V3.Model.JobEvent.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A event issued when a job seeker interacts with the application that
      implements Cloud Talent Solution.
  *   `parentEventId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The event_id of an event that resulted in the current event. For example, a
      Job view event usually follows a parent
      impression event: A job seeker first does a
      search where a list of jobs appears
      (impression). The job seeker then selects a
      result and views the description of a particular job (Job
      view).
  *   `requestId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A unique ID generated in the API responses. It can be found in
      ResponseMetadata.request_id.
