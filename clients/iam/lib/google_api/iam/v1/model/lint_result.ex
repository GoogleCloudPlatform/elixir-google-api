defmodule GoogleApi.IAM.V1.Model.LintResult do
  @moduledoc """
  Structured response of a single validation unit.

  ## Attributes

  - bindingOrdinal (integer()): 0-based index ordinality of the binding in the input object associated
  with this result.
  This field is populated only if the input object to lint is of type
  google.iam.v1.Policy, which can comprise more than one binding.
  It is set to -1 if the result is not associated with any particular
  binding and only targets the policy as a whole, such as results about
  policy size violations. Defaults to `nil`.
  - debugMessage (String.t): Human readable debug message associated with the issue. Defaults to `nil`.
  - fieldName (String.t): The name of the field for which this lint result is about.

  For nested messages, `field_name` consists of names of the embedded fields
  separated by period character. The top-level qualifier is the input object
  to lint in the request. For instance, if the lint request is on a
  google.iam.v1.Policy and this lint result is about a condition
  expression of one of the input policy bindings, the field would be
  populated as `policy.bindings.condition.expression`.

  This field does not identify the ordinality of the repetitive fields (for
  instance bindings in a policy). Defaults to `nil`.
  - level (String.t): The validation unit level. Defaults to `nil`.
  - locationOffset (integer()): 0-based character position of problematic construct within the object
  identified by `field_name`. Currently, this is populated only for condition
  expression. Defaults to `nil`.
  - severity (String.t): The validation unit severity. Defaults to `nil`.
  - validationUnitName (String.t): The validation unit name, for instance
  “lintValidationUnits/ConditionComplexityCheck”. Defaults to `nil`.
