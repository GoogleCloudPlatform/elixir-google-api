defmodule GoogleApi.IAM.V1.Model.ServiceAccount do
  @moduledoc """
  A service account in the Identity and Access Management API.  To create a service account, specify the &#x60;project_id&#x60; and the &#x60;account_id&#x60; for the account.  The &#x60;account_id&#x60; is unique within the project, and is used to generate the service account email address and a stable &#x60;unique_id&#x60;.  If the account already exists, the account&#39;s resource name is returned in util::Status&#39;s ResourceInfo.resource_name in the format of projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}. The caller can use the name in other methods to access the account.  All other methods can identify the service account using the format &#x60;projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}&#x60;. Using &#x60;-&#x60; as a wildcard for the project will infer the project from the account. The &#x60;account&#x60; value can be the &#x60;email&#x60; address or the &#x60;unique_id&#x60; of the service account.
