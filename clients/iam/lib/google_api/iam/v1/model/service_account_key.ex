defmodule GoogleApi.IAM.V1.Model.ServiceAccountKey do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a service account key.  A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and system-managed.  User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users.  Users are responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of their service accounts.  Users retain the private key of these key-pairs, and Google retains ONLY the public key.  System-managed key-pairs are managed automatically by Google, and rotated daily without user intervention.  The private key never leaves Google&#39;s servers to maximize security.  Public keys for all service accounts are also published at the OAuth2 Service Account API.
