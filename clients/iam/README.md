# GoogleApi.IAM

Identity and Access Management (IAM) API client library.

 Manages identity and access control for Google Cloud Platform resources, including the creation of service accounts, which you can use to authenticate to Google and make API calls. *Note:* This API is tied to the IAM service account credentials API ( iamcredentials.googleapis.com). Enabling or disabling this API will also enable or disable the IAM service account credentials API.
