defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.KeySet do
  @moduledoc """
  `KeySet` defines a collection of Cloud Spanner keys and/or key ranges. All
  the keys are expected to be in the same table or index. The keys need
  not be sorted in any particular way.

  If the same key is specified multiple times in the set (for example
  if two ranges, two keys, or a key and a range overlap), Cloud Spanner
  behaves as if the key were only specified once.

  ## Attributes

  - all (boolean()): For convenience `all` can be set to `true` to indicate that this
  `KeySet` matches all keys in the table or index. Note that any keys
  specified in `keys` or `ranges` are only yielded once. Defaults to `nil`.
  - keys (list(list(any()))): A list of specific keys. Entries in `keys` should have exactly as
  many elements as there are columns in the primary or index key
  with which this `KeySet` is used.  Individual key values are
  encoded as described here. Defaults to `nil`.
  - ranges (list(GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.KeyRange.t)): A list of key ranges. See KeyRange for more information about
  key range specifications. Defaults to `nil`.
