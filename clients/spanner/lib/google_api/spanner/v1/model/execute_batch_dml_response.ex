defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ExecuteBatchDmlResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response for ExecuteBatchDml. Contains a list
  of ResultSet, one for each DML statement that has successfully executed.
  If a statement fails, the error is returned as part of the response payload.
  Clients can determine whether all DML statements have run successfully, or if
  a statement failed, using one of the following approaches:

    1. Check if `'status'` field is `OkStatus`.
    2. Check if `result_sets_size()` equals the number of statements in
       ExecuteBatchDmlRequest.

  Example 1: A request with 5 DML statements, all executed successfully.

  Result: A response with 5 ResultSets, one for each statement in the same
  order, and an `OkStatus`.

  Example 2: A request with 5 DML statements. The 3rd statement has a syntax
  error.

  Result: A response with 2 ResultSets, for the first 2 statements that
  run successfully, and a syntax error (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`) status. From
  `result_set_size()` client can determine that the 3rd statement has failed.

  ## Attributes

  *   `resultSets` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.ResultSet.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - ResultSets, one for each statement in the request that ran successfully, in
      the same order as the statements in the request. Each ResultSet will
      not contain any rows. The ResultSetStats in each ResultSet will
      contain the number of rows modified by the statement.

      Only the first ResultSet in the response contains a valid
      ResultSetMetadata.
  *   `status` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Status.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If all DML statements are executed successfully, status will be OK.
      Otherwise, the error status of the first failed statement.
