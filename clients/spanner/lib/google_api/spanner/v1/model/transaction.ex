  A transaction.

  ## Attributes

  - id (String): &#x60;id&#x60; may be used to identify the transaction in subsequent Read, ExecuteSql, Commit, or Rollback calls.  Single-use read-only transactions do not have IDs, because single-use transactions do not support multiple requests. Defaults to: `null`.
  - readTimestamp (String): For snapshot read-only transactions, the read timestamp chosen for the transaction. Not returned by default: see TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.return_read_timestamp. Defaults to: `null`.
