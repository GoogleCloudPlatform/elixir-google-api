  This message is used to select the transaction in which a Read or ExecuteSql call runs.  See TransactionOptions for more information about transactions.

  ## Attributes

  - begin (TransactionOptions): Begin a new transaction and execute this read or SQL query in it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (binary()): Execute the read or SQL query in a previously-started transaction. Defaults to: `null`.
  - singleUse (TransactionOptions): Execute the read or SQL query in a temporary transaction. This is the most efficient way to execute a transaction that consists of a single SQL query. Defaults to: `null`.
