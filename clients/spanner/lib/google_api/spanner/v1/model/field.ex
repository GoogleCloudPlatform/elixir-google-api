defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.Field do
  @moduledoc """
  Message representing a single field of a struct.

  ## Attributes

  - name (String): The name of the field. For reads, this is the column name. For SQL queries, it is the column alias (e.g., &#x60;\&quot;Word\&quot;&#x60; in the query &#x60;\&quot;SELECT &#39;hello&#39; AS Word\&quot;&#x60;), or the column name (e.g., &#x60;\&quot;ColName\&quot;&#x60; in the query &#x60;\&quot;SELECT ColName FROM Table\&quot;&#x60;). Some columns might have an empty name (e.g., !\&quot;SELECT UPPER(ColName)\&quot;&#x60;). Note that a query result can contain multiple fields with the same name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - type (Type): The type of the field. Defaults to: `null`.
