defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.UpdateInstanceRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  The request for UpdateInstance.

  ## Attributes

  - fieldMask (String): Required. A mask specifying which fields in [][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.UpdateInstanceRequest.instance] should be updated. The field mask must always be specified; this prevents any future fields in [][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.Instance] from being erased accidentally by clients that do not know about them. Defaults to: `null`.
  - instance (Instance): Required. The instance to update, which must always include the instance name.  Otherwise, only fields mentioned in [][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.UpdateInstanceRequest.field_mask] need be included. Defaults to: `null`.
