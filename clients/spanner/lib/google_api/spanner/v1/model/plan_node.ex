defmodule GoogleApi.Spanner.V1.Model.PlanNode do
  @moduledoc """
  Node information for nodes appearing in a QueryPlan.plan_nodes.

  ## Attributes

  - childLinks (List[ChildLink]): List of child node &#x60;index&#x60;es and their relationship to this parent. Defaults to: `null`.
  - displayName (String): The display name for the node. Defaults to: `null`.
  - executionStats (Object): The execution statistics associated with the node, contained in a group of key-value pairs. Only present if the plan was returned as a result of a profile query. For example, number of executions, number of rows/time per execution etc. Defaults to: `null`.
  - index (Integer): The &#x60;PlanNode&#x60;&#39;s index in node list. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): Used to determine the type of node. May be needed for visualizing different kinds of nodes differently. For example, If the node is a SCALAR node, it will have a condensed representation which can be used to directly embed a description of the node in its parent. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [KIND_UNSPECIFIED, RELATIONAL, SCALAR]
  - metadata (Object): Attributes relevant to the node contained in a group of key-value pairs. For example, a Parameter Reference node could have the following information in its metadata:      {       \&quot;parameter_reference\&quot;: \&quot;param1\&quot;,       \&quot;parameter_type\&quot;: \&quot;array\&quot;     } Defaults to: `null`.
  - shortRepresentation (ShortRepresentation): Condensed representation for SCALAR nodes. Defaults to: `null`.
