defmodule GoogleApi.AppEngine.V1.Model.TrafficSplit do
  @moduledoc """
  Traffic routing configuration for versions within a single service. Traffic splits define how traffic directed to the service is assigned to versions.

  ## Attributes

  - allocations (Map[String, Float]): Mapping from version IDs within the service to fractional (0.000, 1] allocations of traffic for that version. Each version can be specified only once, but some versions in the service may not have any traffic allocation. Services that have traffic allocated cannot be deleted until either the service is deleted or their traffic allocation is removed. Allocations must sum to 1. Up to two decimal place precision is supported for IP-based splits and up to three decimal places is supported for cookie-based splits. Defaults to: `null`.
  - shardBy (String): Mechanism used to determine which version a request is sent to. The traffic selection algorithm will be stable for either type until allocations are changed. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNSPECIFIED, COOKIE, IP, RANDOM]
