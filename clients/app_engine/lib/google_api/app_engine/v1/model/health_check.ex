  @moduledoc """
  Health checking configuration for VM instances. Unhealthy instances are killed and replaced with new instances. Only applicable for instances in App Engine flexible environment.

  ## Attributes

  - checkInterval (String.t): Interval between health checks. Defaults to `nil`.
  - disableHealthCheck (boolean()): Whether to explicitly disable health checks for this instance. Defaults to `nil`.
  - healthyThreshold (integer()): Number of consecutive successful health checks required before receiving traffic. Defaults to `nil`.
  - host (String.t): Host header to send when performing an HTTP health check. Example: "myapp.appspot.com" Defaults to `nil`.
  - restartThreshold (integer()): Number of consecutive failed health checks required before an instance is restarted. Defaults to `nil`.
  - timeout (String.t): Time before the health check is considered failed. Defaults to `nil`.
  - unhealthyThreshold (integer()): Number of consecutive failed health checks required before removing traffic. Defaults to `nil`.
