defmodule GoogleApi.AppEngine.V1.Model.FeatureSettings do
  @moduledoc """
  The feature specific settings to be used in the application. These define behaviors that are user configurable.

  ## Attributes

  - splitHealthChecks (Boolean): Boolean value indicating if split health checks should be used instead of the legacy health checks. At an app.yaml level, this means defaulting to &#39;readiness_check&#39; and &#39;liveness_check&#39; values instead of &#39;health_check&#39; ones. Once the legacy &#39;health_check&#39; behavior is deprecated, and this value is always true, this setting can be removed. Defaults to: `null`.
