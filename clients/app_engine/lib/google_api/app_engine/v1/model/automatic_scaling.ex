defmodule GoogleApi.AppEngine.V1.Model.AutomaticScaling do
  @moduledoc """
  Automatic scaling is based on request rate, response latencies, and other application metrics.

  ## Attributes

  - coolDownPeriod (String): Amount of time that the Autoscaler (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/) should wait between changes to the number of virtual machines. Only applicable for VM runtimes. Defaults to: `null`.
  - cpuUtilization (CpuUtilization): Target scaling by CPU usage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - diskUtilization (DiskUtilization): Target scaling by disk usage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxConcurrentRequests (Integer): Number of concurrent requests an automatic scaling instance can accept before the scheduler spawns a new instance.Defaults to a runtime-specific value. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxIdleInstances (Integer): Maximum number of idle instances that should be maintained for this version. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxPendingLatency (String): Maximum amount of time that a request should wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxTotalInstances (Integer): Maximum number of instances that should be started to handle requests. Defaults to: `null`.
  - minIdleInstances (Integer): Minimum number of idle instances that should be maintained for this version. Only applicable for the default version of a service. Defaults to: `null`.
  - minPendingLatency (String): Minimum amount of time a request should wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it. Defaults to: `null`.
  - minTotalInstances (Integer): Minimum number of instances that should be maintained for this version. Defaults to: `null`.
  - networkUtilization (NetworkUtilization): Target scaling by network usage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestUtilization (RequestUtilization): Target scaling by request utilization. Defaults to: `null`.
