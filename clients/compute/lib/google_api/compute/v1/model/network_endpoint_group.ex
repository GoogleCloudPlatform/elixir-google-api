defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.NetworkEndpointGroup do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a collection of network endpoints.

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - defaultPort (integer()): The default port used if the port number is not specified in the network endpoint. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkEndpointGroup for network endpoint group. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - network (String.t): The URL of the network to which all network endpoints in the NEG belong. Uses \&quot;default\&quot; project network if unspecified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - networkEndpointType (String.t): Type of network endpoints in this network endpoint group. Currently the only supported value is GCE_VM_IP_PORT. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [GCE_VM_IP_PORT]
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - size (integer()): [Output only] Number of network endpoints in the network endpoint group. Defaults to: `null`.
  - subnetwork (String.t): Optional URL of the subnetwork to which all network endpoints in the NEG belong. Defaults to: `null`.
  - zone (String.t): [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the network endpoint group is located. Defaults to: `null`.
