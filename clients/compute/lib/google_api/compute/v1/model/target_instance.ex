defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.TargetInstance do
  @moduledoc """
  A TargetInstance resource. This resource defines an endpoint instance that terminates traffic of certain protocols. (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for beta.targetInstances &#x3D;&#x3D;) (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for v1.targetInstances &#x3D;&#x3D;)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - instance (String.t): A URL to the virtual machine instance that handles traffic for this target instance. When creating a target instance, you can provide the fully-qualified URL or a valid partial URL to the desired virtual machine. For example, the following are all valid URLs:  - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance  - projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance  - zones/zone/instances/instance Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] The type of the resource. Always compute#targetInstance for target instances. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - natPolicy (String.t): NAT option controlling how IPs are NAT&#39;ed to the instance. Currently only NO_NAT (default value) is supported. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [NO_NAT]
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - zone (String.t): [Output Only] URL of the zone where the target instance resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. Defaults to: `null`.
