defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.Commitment do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a regional Commitment resource.

  Creating a commitment resource means that you are purchasing a committed use contract with an explicit start and end time. You can create commitments based on vCPUs and memory usage and receive discounted rates. For full details, read Signing Up for Committed Use Discounts. (== resource_for beta.regionCommitments ==) (== resource_for v1.regionCommitments ==)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to `nil`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to `nil`.
  - endTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Commitment end time in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to `nil`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to `nil`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#commitment for commitments. Defaults to `compute#commitment`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to `nil`.
  - plan (String.t): The plan for this commitment, which determines duration and discount rate. The currently supported plans are TWELVE_MONTH (1 year), and THIRTY_SIX_MONTH (3 years). Defaults to `nil`.
  - region (String.t): [Output Only] URL of the region where this commitment may be used. Defaults to `nil`.
  - resources (list(GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.ResourceCommitment.t)): A list of commitment amounts for particular resources. Note that VCPU and MEMORY resource commitments must occur together. Defaults to `nil`.
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to `nil`.
  - startTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Commitment start time in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to `nil`.
  - status (String.t): [Output Only] Status of the commitment with regards to eventual expiration (each commitment has an end date defined). One of the following values: NOT_YET_ACTIVE, ACTIVE, EXPIRED. Defaults to `nil`.
  - statusMessage (String.t): [Output Only] An optional, human-readable explanation of the status. Defaults to `nil`.
