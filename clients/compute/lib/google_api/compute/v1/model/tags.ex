defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.Tags do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of instance tags.

  ## Attributes

  - fingerprint (binary()): Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the tags&#39; contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update tags. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change tags.  To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance. Defaults to: `null`.
  - items ([String.t]): An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Defaults to: `null`.
