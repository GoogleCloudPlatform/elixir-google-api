  ## Attributes

  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#projectsGetXpnResources for lists of service resources (a.k.a service projects) Defaults to: `null`.
  - nextPageToken (String.t): [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results. Defaults to: `null`.
  - resources ([XpnResourceId]): Service resources (a.k.a service projects) attached to this project as their shared VPC host. Defaults to: `null`.
