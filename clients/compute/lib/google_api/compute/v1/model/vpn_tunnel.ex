defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.VpnTunnel do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a Cloud VPN Tunnel resource.

  For more information about VPN, read the the Cloud VPN Overview. (== resource_for beta.vpnTunnels ==) (== resource_for v1.vpnTunnels ==)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to `nil`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to `nil`.
  - detailedStatus (String.t): [Output Only] Detailed status message for the VPN tunnel. Defaults to `nil`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to `nil`.
  - ikeVersion (integer()): IKE protocol version to use when establishing the VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. Acceptable IKE versions are 1 or 2. The default version is 2. Defaults to `nil`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#vpnTunnel for VPN tunnels. Defaults to `compute#vpnTunnel`.
  - localTrafficSelector (list(String.t)): Local traffic selector to use when establishing the VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges must be disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to `nil`.
  - peerIp (String.t): IP address of the peer VPN gateway. Only IPv4 is supported. Defaults to `nil`.
  - region (String.t): [Output Only] URL of the region where the VPN tunnel resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. Defaults to `nil`.
  - remoteTrafficSelector (list(String.t)): Remote traffic selectors to use when establishing the VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges should be disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported. Defaults to `nil`.
  - router (String.t): URL of the router resource to be used for dynamic routing. Defaults to `nil`.
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to `nil`.
  - sharedSecret (String.t): Shared secret used to set the secure session between the Cloud VPN gateway and the peer VPN gateway. Defaults to `nil`.
  - sharedSecretHash (String.t): Hash of the shared secret. Defaults to `nil`.
  - status (String.t): [Output Only] The status of the VPN tunnel, which can be one of the following: 
  - PROVISIONING: Resource is being allocated for the VPN tunnel. 
  - WAITING_FOR_FULL_CONFIG: Waiting to receive all VPN-related configs from the user. Network, TargetVpnGateway, VpnTunnel, ForwardingRule, and Route resources are needed to setup the VPN tunnel. 
  - FIRST_HANDSHAKE: Successful first handshake with the peer VPN. 
  - ESTABLISHED: Secure session is successfully established with the peer VPN. 
  - NETWORK_ERROR: Deprecated, replaced by NO_INCOMING_PACKETS 
  - AUTHORIZATION_ERROR: Auth error (for example, bad shared secret). 
  - NEGOTIATION_FAILURE: Handshake failed. 
  - DEPROVISIONING: Resources are being deallocated for the VPN tunnel. 
  - FAILED: Tunnel creation has failed and the tunnel is not ready to be used. Defaults to `nil`.
  - targetVpnGateway (String.t): URL of the Target VPN gateway with which this VPN tunnel is associated. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel is created. Defaults to `nil`.
