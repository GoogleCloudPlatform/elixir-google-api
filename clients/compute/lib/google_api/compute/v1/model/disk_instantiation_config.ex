defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.DiskInstantiationConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  A specification of the desired way to instantiate a disk in the instance template when its created from a source instance.

  ## Attributes

  - autoDelete (boolean()): Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the instance). Defaults to: `null`.
  - customImage (String.t): The custom source image to be used to restore this disk when instantiating this instance template. Defaults to: `null`.
  - deviceName (String.t): Specifies the device name of the disk to which the configurations apply to. Defaults to: `null`.
  - instantiateFrom (String.t): Specifies whether to include the disk and what image to use. Possible values are:   - source-image: to use the same image that was used to create the source instance&#39;s corresponding disk. Applicable to the boot disk and additional read-write disks.  - source-image-family: to use the same image family that was used to create the source instance&#39;s corresponding disk. Applicable to the boot disk and additional read-write disks.  - custom-image: to use a user-provided image url for disk creation. Applicable to the boot disk and additional read-write disks.  - attach-read-only: to attach a read-only disk. Applicable to read-only disks.  - do-not-include: to exclude a disk from the template. Applicable to additional read-write disks, local SSDs, and read-only disks. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [ATTACH_READ_ONLY, BLANK, CUSTOM_IMAGE, DEFAULT, DO_NOT_INCLUDE, SOURCE_IMAGE, SOURCE_IMAGE_FAMILY]
