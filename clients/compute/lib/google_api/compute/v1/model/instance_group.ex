  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] The creation timestamp for this instance group in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fingerprint (binary()): [Output Only] The fingerprint of the named ports. The system uses this fingerprint to detect conflicts when multiple users change the named ports concurrently. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] A unique identifier for this instance group, generated by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] The resource type, which is always compute#instanceGroup for instance groups. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The name of the instance group. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Defaults to: `null`.
  - namedPorts ([NamedPort]): Assigns a name to a port number. For example: {name: \&quot;http\&quot;, port: 80}  This allows the system to reference ports by the assigned name instead of a port number. Named ports can also contain multiple ports. For example: [{name: \&quot;http\&quot;, port: 80},{name: \&quot;http\&quot;, port: 8080}]   Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group. Defaults to: `null`.
  - network (String.t): The URL of the network to which all instances in the instance group belong. Defaults to: `null`.
  - region (String.t): [Output Only] The URL of the region where the instance group is located (for regional resources). Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] The URL for this instance group. The server generates this URL. Defaults to: `null`.
  - size (integer()): [Output Only] The total number of instances in the instance group. Defaults to: `null`.
  - subnetwork (String.t): [Output Only] The URL of the subnetwork to which all instances in the instance group belong. Defaults to: `null`.
  - zone (String.t): [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the instance group is located (for zonal resources). Defaults to: `null`.
