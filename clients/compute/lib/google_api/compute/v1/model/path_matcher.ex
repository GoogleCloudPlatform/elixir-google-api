defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.PathMatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  A matcher for the path portion of the URL. The BackendService from the longest-matched rule will serve the URL. If no rule was matched, the default service will be used.

  ## Attributes

  - defaultService (String.t): The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource. This will be used if none of the pathRules defined by this PathMatcher is matched by the URL&#39;s path portion. For example, the following are all valid URLs to a BackendService resource:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService  - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService  - global/backendServices/backendService Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pathRules ([PathRule]): The list of path rules. Defaults to: `null`.
