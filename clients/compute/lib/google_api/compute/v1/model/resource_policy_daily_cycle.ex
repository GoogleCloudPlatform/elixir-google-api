  ## Attributes

  - daysInCycle (integer()): Defines a schedule that runs every nth day of the month. Defaults to: `null`.
  - duration (String.t): [Output only] A predetermined duration for the window, automatically chosen to be the smallest possible in the given scenario. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String.t): Start time of the window. This must be in UTC format that resolves to one of 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, or 20:00. For example, both 13:00-5 and 08:00 are valid. Defaults to: `null`.
