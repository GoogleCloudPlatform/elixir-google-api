  Unlinks an agent user from Google. As a result, all data related to this
  user will be deleted.

  Here is how the agent user is created in Google:

  1.  When a user opens their Google Home App, they can begin linking a 3p
      partner.
  2.  User is guided through the OAuth process.
  3.  After entering the 3p credentials, Google gets the 3p OAuth token and
      uses it to make a Sync call to the 3p partner and gets back all of the
      user's data, including `agent_user_id` and devices.
  4.  Google creates the agent user and stores a mapping from the
      `agent_user_id` -> Google ID mapping. Google also
      stores all of the user's devices under that Google ID.

  The mapping from `agent_user_id` to Google ID is many to many, since one
  Google user can have multiple 3p accounts, and multiple Google users can
  map to one `agent_user_id` (e.g., a husband and wife share one Nest account
  username/password).

  The third-party user's identity is passed in as `agent_user_id`.
  The agent is identified by the JWT signed by the partner's service account.

  Note: Special characters (except "/") in `agent_user_id` must be
  URL-encoded.

  ## Parameters

  *   `connection` (*type:* `GoogleApi.HomeGraph.V1.Connection.t`) - Connection to server
  *   `agent_users_id` (*type:* `String.t`) - Part of `agentUserId`. Required. Third-party user ID.
  *   `optional_params` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Optional parameters
      *   `:"$.xgafv"` (*type:* `String.t`) - V1 error format.
      *   `:access_token` (*type:* `String.t`) - OAuth access token.
      *   `:alt` (*type:* `String.t`) - Data format for response.
      *   `:callback` (*type:* `String.t`) - JSONP
      *   `:fields` (*type:* `String.t`) - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
      *   `:key` (*type:* `String.t`) - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
      *   `:oauth_token` (*type:* `String.t`) - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
      *   `:prettyPrint` (*type:* `boolean()`) - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
      *   `:quotaUser` (*type:* `String.t`) - Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
      *   `:uploadType` (*type:* `String.t`) - Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. "media", "multipart").
      *   `:upload_protocol` (*type:* `String.t`) - Upload protocol for media (e.g. "raw", "multipart").
      *   `:requestId` (*type:* `String.t`) - Request ID used for debugging.
  *   `opts` (*type:* `keyword()`) - Call options

  ## Returns

  *   `{:ok, %GoogleApi.HomeGraph.V1.Model.Empty{}}` on success
  *   `{:error, info}` on failure
