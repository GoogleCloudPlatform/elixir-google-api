defmodule GoogleApi.CloudBilling.V1.Model.PricingInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the pricing information for a SKU at a single point of time.

  ## Attributes

  - aggregationInfo (AggregationInfo): Aggregation Info. This can be left unspecified if the pricing expression doesn&#39;t require aggregation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - currencyConversionRate (float()): Conversion rate used for currency conversion, from USD to the currency specified in the request. This includes any surcharge collected for billing in non USD currency. If a currency is not specified in the request this defaults to 1.0. Example: USD * currency_conversion_rate &#x3D; JPY Defaults to: `null`.
  - effectiveTime (DateTime.t): The timestamp from which this pricing was effective within the requested time range. This is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the start_time field in the request and less than the end_time field in the request. If a time range was not specified in the request this field will be equivalent to a time within the last 12 hours, indicating the latest pricing info. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pricingExpression (PricingExpression): Expresses the pricing formula. See &#x60;PricingExpression&#x60; for an example. Defaults to: `null`.
  - summary (String.t): An optional human readable summary of the pricing information, has a maximum length of 256 characters. Defaults to: `null`.
