  - customMetric (List[CustomMetric]): Custom metrics for the conversion. Defaults to: `null`.
  - deviceType (String): The type of device on which the conversion occurred. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dsConversionId (String): ID that DoubleClick Search generates for each conversion. Defaults to: `null`.
  - engineAccountId (String): DS engine account ID. Defaults to: `null`.

  - quantityMillis (String): The quantity of this conversion, in millis. Defaults to: `null`.
  - revenueMicros (String): The revenue amount of this TRANSACTION conversion, in micros (value multiplied by 1000000, no decimal). For example, to specify a revenue value of \&quot;10\&quot; enter \&quot;10000000\&quot; (10 million) in your request. Defaults to: `null`.
  - segmentationId (String): The numeric segmentation identifier (for example, DoubleClick Search Floodlight activity ID). Defaults to: `null`.
  - segmentationName (String): The friendly segmentation identifier (for example, DoubleClick Search Floodlight activity name). Defaults to: `null`.
  - segmentationType (String): The segmentation type of this conversion (for example, FLOODLIGHT). Defaults to: `null`.
  - state (String): The state of the conversion, that is, either ACTIVE or REMOVED. Note: state DELETED is deprecated. Defaults to: `null`.
