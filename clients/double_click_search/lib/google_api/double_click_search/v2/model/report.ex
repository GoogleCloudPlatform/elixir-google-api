defmodule GoogleApi.DoubleClickSearch.V2.Model.Report do
  @moduledoc """
  A DoubleClick Search report. This object contains the report request, some report metadata such as currency code, and the generated report rows or report files.

  ## Attributes

  - files ([ReportFiles]): Asynchronous report only. Contains a list of generated report files once the report has succesfully completed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Asynchronous report only. Id of the report. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isReportReady (boolean()): Asynchronous report only. True if and only if the report has completed successfully and the report files are ready to be downloaded. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies this as a Report resource. Value: the fixed string doubleclicksearch#report. Defaults to: `null`.
  - request (ReportRequest): The request that created the report. Optional fields not specified in the original request are filled with default values. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rowCount (integer()): The number of report rows generated by the report, not including headers. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rows ([ReportRow]): Synchronous report only. Generated report rows. Defaults to: `null`.
  - statisticsCurrencyCode (String.t): The currency code of all monetary values produced in the report, including values that are set by users (e.g., keyword bid settings) and metrics (e.g., cost and revenue). The currency code of a report is determined by the statisticsCurrency field of the report request. Defaults to: `null`.
  - statisticsTimeZone (String.t): If all statistics of the report are sourced from the same time zone, this would be it. Otherwise the field is unset. Defaults to: `null`.
