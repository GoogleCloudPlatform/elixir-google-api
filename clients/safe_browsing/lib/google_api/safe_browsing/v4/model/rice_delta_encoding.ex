defmodule GoogleApi.SafeBrowsing.V4.Model.RiceDeltaEncoding do
  @moduledoc """
  The Rice-Golomb encoded data. Used for sending compressed 4-byte hashes or compressed removal indices.

  ## Attributes

  - encodedData (String): The encoded deltas that are encoded using the Golomb-Rice coder. Defaults to: `null`.
  - firstValue (String): The offset of the first entry in the encoded data, or, if only a single integer was encoded, that single integer&#39;s value. Defaults to: `null`.
  - numEntries (Integer): The number of entries that are delta encoded in the encoded data. If only a single integer was encoded, this will be zero and the single value will be stored in &#x60;first_value&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - riceParameter (Integer): The Golomb-Rice parameter, which is a number between 2 and 28. This field is missing (that is, zero) if &#x60;num_entries&#x60; is zero. Defaults to: `null`.
