  Settings that control the targeting expansion of the line item. Targeting expansion allows the line item to reach a larger audience based on the original audience list and the targeting expansion level.

  ## Attributes

  *   `excludeFirstPartyAudience` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Whether to exclude first party audiences from targeting. Similar audiences of the excluded first party lists will not be excluded. Only applicable when a first-party audience is positively targeted (directly or included in a combined audience), otherwise this selection will be ignored.
  *   `targetingExpansionLevel` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Magnitude of expansion for applicable targeting under this line item.
