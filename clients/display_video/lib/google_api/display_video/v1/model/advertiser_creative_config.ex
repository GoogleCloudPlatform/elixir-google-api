defmodule GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V1.Model.AdvertiserCreativeConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Creatives related settings of an advertiser.

  ## Attributes

  *   `dynamicCreativeEnabled` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether or not the advertiser is enabled for dynamic creatives.
  *   `iasClientId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - An ID for configuring campaign monitoring provided by Integral Ad Service
      (IAS). The DV360 system will append an IAS "Campaign Monitor" tag
      containing this ID to the creative tag.
  *   `obaComplianceDisabled` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether or not to use DV360's Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA)
      compliance.

      Warning: Changing OBA settings may cause the audit status of your creatives
      to be reset by some ad exchanges, making them ineligible to serve until
      they are re-approved.
  *   `videoCreativeDataSharingAuthorized` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - By setting this field to `true`, you, on behalf of your company,
      authorize Google to use video creatives associated with this Display &
      Video 360 advertiser to provide reporting and features related to the
      advertiser's television campaigns.

      Applicable only when the advertiser has a
      CM hybrid ad server
      configuration.
