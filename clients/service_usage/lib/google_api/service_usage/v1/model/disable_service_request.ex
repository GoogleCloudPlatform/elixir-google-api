  ## Attributes

  *   `disableDependentServices` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates if services that are enabled and which depend on this service
      should also be disabled. If not set, an error will be generated if any
      enabled services depend on the service to be disabled. When set, the
      service, and any enabled services that depend on it, will be disabled
      together.
