  Request message for the `BatchEnableServices` method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `serviceIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The identifiers of the services to enable on the project. A valid identifier would be: serviceusage.googleapis.com Enabling services requires that each service is public or is shared with the user enabling the service. A single request can enable a maximum of 20 services at a time. If more than 20 services are specified, the request will fail, and no state changes will occur.
