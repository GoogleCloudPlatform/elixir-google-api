defmodule GoogleApi.ProximityBeacon.V1beta1.Model.Observation do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents one beacon observed once.

  ## Attributes

  - advertisedId (AdvertisedId): The ID advertised by the beacon the client has encountered.  If the submitted &#x60;advertised_id&#x60; type is Eddystone-EID, then the client must be authorized to resolve the given beacon. Otherwise no data will be returned for that beacon. Required. Defaults to: `null`.
  - telemetry (binary()): The array of telemetry bytes received from the beacon. The server is responsible for parsing it. This field may frequently be empty, as with a beacon that transmits telemetry only occasionally. Defaults to: `null`.
  - timestampMs (DateTime.t): Time when the beacon was observed. Defaults to: `null`.
