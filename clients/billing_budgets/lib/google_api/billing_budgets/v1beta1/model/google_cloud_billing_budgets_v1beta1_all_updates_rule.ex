defmodule GoogleApi.BillingBudgets.V1beta1.Model.GoogleCloudBillingBudgetsV1beta1AllUpdatesRule do
  @moduledoc """
  AllUpdatesRule defines notifications that are sent based on budget spend
  and thresholds.

  ## Attributes

  *   `monitoringNotificationChannels` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is in
      addition to default recipients who have billing account roles.
      The value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
      channel with the form
      `projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}`. A maximum of 5
      channels are allowed. See
      https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients
      for more details.
  *   `pubsubTopic` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will be
      published, in the form `projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}`. Updates
      are sent at regular intervals to the topic.
      The topic needs to be created before the budget is created; see
      https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#manage-notifications
      for more details.
      Caller is expected to have
      `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the topic when it's set for a
      budget, otherwise, the API call will fail with PERMISSION_DENIED. See
      https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications
      for more details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions.
  *   `schemaVersion` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The schema version of the notification sent to `pubsub_topic`.
      Only "1.0" is accepted. It represents the JSON schema as defined in
      https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format
