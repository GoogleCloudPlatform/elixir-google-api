  ## Attributes

  - failureCause (String): The cause for the update failure. Possible values are:   - \&quot;TOO_LARGE\&quot;: A batch request was issued with more events than are allowed in a single batch.  - \&quot;TIME_PERIOD_EXPIRED\&quot;: A batch was sent with data too far in the past to record.  - \&quot;TIME_PERIOD_SHORT\&quot;: A batch was sent with a time range that was too short.  - \&quot;TIME_PERIOD_LONG\&quot;: A batch was sent with a time range that was too long.  - \&quot;ALREADY_UPDATED\&quot;: An attempt was made to record a batch of data which was already seen.  - \&quot;RECORD_RATE_HIGH\&quot;: An attempt was made to record data faster than the server will apply updates. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#eventBatchRecordFailure. Defaults to: `null`.
  - range (EventPeriodRange): The time range which was rejected; empty for a request-wide failure. Defaults to: `null`.
