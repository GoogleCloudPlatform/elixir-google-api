defmodule GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.RoomP2PStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  This is a JSON template for an update on the status of a peer in a room.

  ## Attributes

  - connectionSetupLatencyMillis (Integer): The amount of time in milliseconds it took to establish connections with this peer. Defaults to: `null`.
  - error (String): The error code in event of a failure. Possible values are:   - \&quot;P2P_FAILED\&quot; - The client failed to establish a P2P connection with the peer.  - \&quot;PRESENCE_FAILED\&quot; - The client failed to register to receive P2P connections.  - \&quot;RELAY_SERVER_FAILED\&quot; - The client received an error when trying to use the relay server to establish a P2P connection with the peer. Defaults to: `null`.
  - error_reason (String): More detailed diagnostic message returned in event of a failure. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#roomP2PStatus. Defaults to: `null`.
  - participantId (String): The ID of the participant. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String): The status of the peer in the room. Possible values are:   - \&quot;CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED\&quot; - The client established a P2P connection with the peer.  - \&quot;CONNECTION_FAILED\&quot; - The client failed to establish directed presence with the peer. Defaults to: `null`.
  - unreliableRoundtripLatencyMillis (Integer): The amount of time in milliseconds it took to send packets back and forth on the unreliable channel with this peer. Defaults to: `null`.
