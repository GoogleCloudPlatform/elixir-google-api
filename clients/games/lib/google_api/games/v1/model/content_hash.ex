defmodule GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.ContentHash do
  @moduledoc """
  Hash-like weak identifier of uploaded content bytes (saved game data blob, or cover image). Consistent per player per application per hash version. Within the context of a single player/application, it's guaranteed that two identical blobs coming from two different uploads will have the same content hash. It's extremely likely, though not guaranteed, that if two content hashes are equal, the blobs are identical.

  ## Attributes

  *   `digest` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Hash-like digest of the content.
  *   `version` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Version of the Hash encoding algorithm to hash the content.
