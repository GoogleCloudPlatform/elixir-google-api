defmodule GoogleApi.Games.V1.Model.TurnBasedMatchTurn do
  @moduledoc """
  This is a JSON template for the object representing a turn.

  ## Attributes

  - data (TurnBasedMatchDataRequest): The shared game state data after the turn is over. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): Uniquely identifies the type of this resource. Value is always the fixed string games#turnBasedMatchTurn. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchVersion (Integer): The version of this match: an increasing counter, used to avoid out-of-date updates to the match. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pendingParticipantId (String): The ID of the participant who should take their turn next. May be set to the current player&#39;s participant ID to update match state without changing the turn. If not set, the match will wait for other player(s) to join via automatching; this is only valid if automatch criteria is set on the match with remaining slots for automatched players. Defaults to: `null`.
  - results (List[ParticipantResult]): The match results for the participants in the match. Defaults to: `null`.
