  - roomId (String.t): Globally unique ID for a room. Defaults to `nil`.
  - roomStatusVersion (integer()): The version of the room status: an increasing counter, used by the client to ignore out-of-order updates to room status. Defaults to `nil`.

  Possible values are:  
  - "ROOM_INVITING" - One or more players have been invited and not responded. 
  - "ROOM_AUTO_MATCHING" - One or more slots need to be filled by auto-matching. 
  - "ROOM_CONNECTING" - Players have joined and are connecting to each other (either before or after auto-matching). 
  - "ROOM_ACTIVE" - All players have joined and connected to each other. 
  - "ROOM_DELETED" - The room should no longer be shown on the client. Returned in sync calls when a player joins a room (as a tombstone), or for rooms where all joined participants have left. Defaults to `nil`.
