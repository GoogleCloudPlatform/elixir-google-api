defmodule GoogleApi.Dataproc.V1.Model.DiskConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Specifies the config of disk options for a group of VM instances.

  ## Attributes

  - bootDiskSizeGb (Integer): Optional. Size in GB of the boot disk (default is 500GB). Defaults to: `null`.
  - numLocalSsds (Integer): Optional. Number of attached SSDs, from 0 to 4 (default is 0). If SSDs are not attached, the boot disk is used to store runtime logs and HDFS (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_user_guide.html) data. If one or more SSDs are attached, this runtime bulk data is spread across them, and the boot disk contains only basic config and installed binaries. Defaults to: `null`.
