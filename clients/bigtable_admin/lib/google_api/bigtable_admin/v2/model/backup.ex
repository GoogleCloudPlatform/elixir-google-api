defmodule GoogleApi.BigtableAdmin.V2.Model.Backup do
  @moduledoc """
  A backup of a Cloud Bigtable table.

  ## Attributes

  *   `endTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. `end_time` is the time that the backup was finished. The row
      data in the backup will be no newer than this timestamp.
  *   `expireTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The expiration time of the backup, with microseconds
      granularity that must be at least 6 hours and at most 30 days
      from the time the request is received. Once the `expire_time`
      has passed, Cloud Bigtable will delete the backup and free the
      resources used by the backup.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be
      changed. Values are of the form
      `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}/
         backups/_a-zA-Z0-9*`
      The final segment of the name must be between 1 and 50 characters
      in length.

      The backup is stored in the cluster identified by the prefix of the backup
      name of the form
      `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}`.
  *   `sizeBytes` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Size of the backup in bytes.
  *   `sourceTable` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Immutable. Name of the table from which this backup was created. This needs
      to be in the same instance as the backup. Values are of the form
      `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/tables/{source_table}`.
  *   `startTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. `start_time` is the time that the backup was started
      (i.e. approximately the time the
      CreateBackup request is received).  The
      row data in this backup will be no older than this timestamp.
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The current state of the backup.
