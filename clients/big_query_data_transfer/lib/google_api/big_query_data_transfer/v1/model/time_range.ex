defmodule GoogleApi.BigQueryDataTransfer.V1.Model.TimeRange do
  @moduledoc """
  A specification for a time range, this will request transfer runs with run_time between start_time (inclusive) and end_time (exclusive).

  ## Attributes

  - endTime (DateTime.t): End time of the range of transfer runs. For example, &#x60;\&quot;2017-05-30T00:00:00+00:00\&quot;&#x60;. The end_time must not be in the future. Creates transfer runs where run_time is in the range betwen start_time (inclusive) and end_time (exlusive). Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (DateTime.t): Start time of the range of transfer runs. For example, &#x60;\&quot;2017-05-25T00:00:00+00:00\&quot;&#x60;. The start_time must be strictly less than the end_time. Creates transfer runs where run_time is in the range betwen start_time (inclusive) and end_time (exlusive). Defaults to: `null`.
