defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTrace.V1.Model.TraceSpan do
  @moduledoc """
  A span represents a single timed event within a trace. Spans can be nested and form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency of an operation and, optionally, one or more subspans for its suboperations. Spans do not need to be contiguous. There may be gaps between spans in a trace.
