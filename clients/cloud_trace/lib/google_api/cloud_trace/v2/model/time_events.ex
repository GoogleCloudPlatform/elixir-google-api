  A collection of &#x60;TimeEvent&#x60;s. A &#x60;TimeEvent&#x60; is a time-stamped annotation on the span, consisting of either user-supplied key:value pairs, or details of a message sent/received between Spans.

  ## Attributes

  - droppedAnnotationsCount (integer()): The number of dropped annotations in all the included time events. If the value is 0, then no annotations were dropped. Defaults to: `null`.
  - droppedMessageEventsCount (integer()): The number of dropped message events in all the included time events. If the value is 0, then no message events were dropped. Defaults to: `null`.
  - timeEvent ([TimeEvent]): A collection of &#x60;TimeEvent&#x60;s. Defaults to: `null`.
