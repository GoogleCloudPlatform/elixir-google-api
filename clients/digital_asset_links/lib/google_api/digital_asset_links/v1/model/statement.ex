defmodule GoogleApi.DigitalAssetLinks.V1.Model.Statement do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes a reliable statement that has been made about the relationship
  between a source asset and a target asset.

  Statements are always made by the source asset, either directly or by
  delegating to a statement list that is stored elsewhere.

  For more detailed definitions of statements and assets, please refer
  to our [API documentation landing
  page](/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started).

  ## Attributes

  - relation (String.t): The relation identifies the use of the statement as intended by the source
  asset's owner (that is, the person or entity who issued the statement).
  Every complete statement has a relation.

  We identify relations with strings of the format `<kind>/<detail>`, where
  `<kind>` must be one of a set of pre-defined purpose categories, and
  `<detail>` is a free-form lowercase alphanumeric string that describes the
  specific use case of the statement.

  Refer to [our API documentation](/digital-asset-links/v1/relation-strings)
  for the current list of supported relations.

  Example: `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`
  REQUIRED Defaults to `nil`.
  - source (GoogleApi.DigitalAssetLinks.V1.Model.Asset.t): Every statement has a source asset.
  REQUIRED Defaults to `nil`.
  - target (GoogleApi.DigitalAssetLinks.V1.Model.Asset.t): Every statement has a target asset.
  REQUIRED Defaults to `nil`.
