defmodule GoogleApi.DNS.V1.Model.Operation do
  @moduledoc """
  An operation represents a successful mutation performed on a Cloud DNS resource. Operations provide: - An audit log of server resource mutations. - A way to recover/retry API calls in the case where the response is never received by the caller. Use the caller specified client_operation_id.

  ## Attributes

  - dnsKeyContext (OperationDnsKeyContext): Only populated if the operation targeted a DnsKey (output only). Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Unique identifier for the resource. This is the client_operation_id if the client specified it when the mutation was initiated, otherwise, it is generated by the server. The name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [-a-z0-9]? (output only) Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \&quot;dns#operation\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String.t): The time that this operation was started by the server. This is in RFC3339 text format (output only). Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String.t): Status of the operation. Can be one of the following: \&quot;PENDING\&quot; or \&quot;DONE\&quot; (output only). Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [done, pending]
  - type (String.t): Type of the operation. Operations include insert, update, and delete (output only). Defaults to: `null`.
  - user (String.t): User who requested the operation, for example: user@example.com. cloud-dns-system for operations automatically done by the system. (output only) Defaults to: `null`.
  - zoneContext (OperationManagedZoneContext): Only populated if the operation targeted a ManagedZone (output only). Defaults to: `null`.
