defmodule GoogleApi.DNS.V1.Model.Change do
  @moduledoc """
  A Change represents a set of ResourceRecordSet additions and deletions applied atomically to a ManagedZone. ResourceRecordSets within a ManagedZone are modified by creating a new Change element in the Changes collection. In turn the Changes collection also records the past modifications to the ResourceRecordSets in a ManagedZone. The current state of the ManagedZone is the sum effect of applying all Change elements in the Changes collection in sequence.

  ## Attributes

  - additions ([ResourceRecordSet]): Which ResourceRecordSets to add? Defaults to: `null`.
  - deletions ([ResourceRecordSet]): Which ResourceRecordSets to remove? Must match existing data exactly. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server (output only). Defaults to: `null`.
  - isServing (boolean()): If the DNS queries for the zone will be served. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \&quot;dns#change\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (String.t): The time that this operation was started by the server (output only). This is in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String.t): Status of the operation (output only). A status of \&quot;done\&quot; means that the request to update the authoritative servers has been sent, but the servers might not be updated yet. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [done, pending]
