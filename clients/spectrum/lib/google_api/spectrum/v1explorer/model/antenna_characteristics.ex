defmodule GoogleApi.Spectrum.V1explorer.Model.AntennaCharacteristics do
  @moduledoc """
  Antenna characteristics provide additional information, such as the antenna height, antenna type, etc. Whether antenna characteristics must be provided in a request depends on the device type and regulatory domain.

  ## Attributes

  - height (float()): The antenna height in meters. Whether the antenna height is required depends on the device type and the regulatory domain. Note that the height may be negative. Defaults to: `null`.
  - heightType (String.t): If the height is required, then the height type (AGL for above ground level or AMSL for above mean sea level) is also required. The default is AGL. Defaults to: `null`.
  - heightUncertainty (float()): The height uncertainty in meters. Whether this is required depends on the regulatory domain. Defaults to: `null`.
