defmodule GoogleApi.MachineLearning.V1.Model.GoogleCloudMlV1Model do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a machine learning solution.  A model can have multiple versions, each of which is a deployed, trained model ready to receive prediction requests. The model itself is just a container.

  ## Attributes

  - defaultVersion (GoogleCloudMlV1Version): Output only. The default version of the model. This version will be used to handle prediction requests that do not specify a version.  You can change the default version by calling [projects.methods.versions.setDefault](/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions/setDefault). Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): Optional. The description specified for the model when it was created. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Required. The name specified for the model when it was created.  The model name must be unique within the project it is created in. Defaults to: `null`.
  - onlinePredictionLogging (boolean()): Optional. If true, enables StackDriver Logging for online prediction. Default is false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - regions ([String.t]): Optional. The list of regions where the model is going to be deployed. Currently only one region per model is supported. Defaults to &#39;us-central1&#39; if nothing is set. See the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/regions\&quot;&gt;available regions&lt;/a&gt; for ML Engine services. Note: *   No matter where a model is deployed, it can always be accessed by     users from anywhere, both for online and batch prediction. *   The region for a batch prediction job is set by the region field when     submitting the batch prediction job and does not take its value from     this field. Defaults to: `null`.
