defmodule GoogleApi.MachineLearning.V1.Model.GoogleCloudMlV1BuiltInAlgorithmOutput do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents output related to a built-in algorithm Job.

  ## Attributes

  - framework (String.t): Framework on which the built-in algorithm was trained. Defaults to: `null`.
  - modelPath (String.t): The Cloud Storage path to the &#x60;model/&#x60; directory where the training job saves the trained model. Only set for successful jobs that don&#39;t use hyperparameter tuning. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pythonVersion (String.t): Python version on which the built-in algorithm was trained. Defaults to: `null`.
  - runtimeVersion (String.t): Cloud ML Engine runtime version on which the built-in algorithm was trained. Defaults to: `null`.
