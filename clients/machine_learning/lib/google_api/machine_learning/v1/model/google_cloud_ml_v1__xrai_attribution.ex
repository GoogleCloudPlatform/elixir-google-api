  Attributes credit by computing the XRAI taking advantage
  of the model's fully differentiable structure. Refer to this paper for
  more details: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02825
  Currently only implemented for models with natural image inputs.

  ## Attributes

  *   `numIntegralSteps` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Number of steps for approximating the path integral.
      A good value to start is 50 and gradually increase until the
      sum to diff property is met within the desired error range.
