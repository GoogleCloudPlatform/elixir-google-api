defmodule GoogleApi.MachineLearning.V1.Model.GoogleIamV1_LogConfig_CounterOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Increment a streamz counter with the specified metric and field names.  Metric names should start with a &#39;/&#39;, generally be lowercase-only, and end in \&quot;_count\&quot;. Field names should not contain an initial slash. The actual exported metric names will have \&quot;/iam/policy\&quot; prepended.  Field names correspond to IAM request parameters and field values are their respective values.  At present the only supported field names are    - \&quot;iam_principal\&quot;, corresponding to IAMContext.principal;    - \&quot;\&quot; (empty string), resulting in one aggretated counter with no field.  Examples:   counter { metric: \&quot;/debug_access_count\&quot;  field: \&quot;iam_principal\&quot; }   &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; increment counter /iam/policy/backend_debug_access_count                         {iam_principal&#x3D;[value of IAMContext.principal]}  At this time we do not support: * multiple field names (though this may be supported in the future) * decrementing the counter * incrementing it by anything other than 1
