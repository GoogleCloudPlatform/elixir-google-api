  ## Attributes

  - backgroundImageFile (DriveBackgroundImageFile):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - backgroundImageLink (String.t): A short-lived link to this shared drive&#39;s background image. Defaults to: `null`.
  - capabilities (DriveCapabilities):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - colorRgb (String.t): The color of this shared drive as an RGB hex string. It can only be set on a drive.drives.update request that does not set themeId. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createdTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the shared drive was created (RFC 3339 date-time). Defaults to: `null`.
  - hidden (boolean()): Whether the shared drive is hidden from default view. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): The ID of this shared drive which is also the ID of the top level folder of this shared drive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \&quot;drive#drive\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The name of this shared drive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - restrictions (DriveRestrictions):  Defaults to: `null`.
  - themeId (String.t): The ID of the theme from which the background image and color will be set. The set of possible driveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.drives.create request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don&#39;t set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile. Defaults to: `null`.
