  Representation of a shared drive.

  ## Attributes

  - backgroundImageFile (GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.DriveBackgroundImageFile.t): An image file and cropping parameters from which a background image for this shared drive is set. This is a write only field; it can only be set on drive.drives.update requests that don't set themeId. When specified, all fields of the backgroundImageFile must be set. Defaults to `nil`.
  - backgroundImageLink (String.t): A short-lived link to this shared drive's background image. Defaults to `nil`.
  - capabilities (GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.DriveCapabilities.t): Capabilities the current user has on this shared drive. Defaults to `nil`.
  - colorRgb (String.t): The color of this shared drive as an RGB hex string. It can only be set on a drive.drives.update request that does not set themeId. Defaults to `nil`.
  - createdTime (DateTime.t): The time at which the shared drive was created (RFC 3339 date-time). Defaults to `nil`.
  - hidden (boolean()): Whether the shared drive is hidden from default view. Defaults to `nil`.
  - id (String.t): The ID of this shared drive which is also the ID of the top level folder of this shared drive. Defaults to `nil`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "drive#drive". Defaults to `drive#drive`.
  - name (String.t): The name of this shared drive. Defaults to `nil`.
  - restrictions (GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.DriveRestrictions.t): A set of restrictions that apply to this shared drive or items inside this shared drive. Defaults to `nil`.
  - themeId (String.t): The ID of the theme from which the background image and color will be set. The set of possible driveThemes can be retrieved from a drive.about.get response. When not specified on a drive.drives.create request, a random theme is chosen from which the background image and color are set. This is a write-only field; it can only be set on requests that don't set colorRgb or backgroundImageFile. Defaults to `nil`.
