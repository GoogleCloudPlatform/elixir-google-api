defmodule GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.ContentRestriction do
  @moduledoc """
  A restriction for accessing the content of the file.

  ## Attributes

  *   `readOnly` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the content of the file is read-only.
  *   `reason` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Reason for why the content of the file is restricted. This is only mutable on requests that also set readOnly=true.
  *   `restrictingUser` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.User.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The user who set the content restriction. Only populated if readOnly is true.
  *   `restrictionTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time at which the content restriction was set (formatted RFC 3339 timestamp). Only populated if readOnly is true.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The type of the content restriction. Currently the only possible value is globalContentRestriction.
