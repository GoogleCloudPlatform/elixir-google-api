defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.EnumOperatorOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Used to provide a search operator for enum properties. This is
  optional. Search operators let users restrict the query to specific fields
  relevant to the type of item being searched. For example, if you provide no
  operator for a *priority* enum property with possible values *p0* and *p1*,
  a query that contains the term *p0* returns items that have *p0* as the
  value of the *priority* property, as well as any items that contain the
  string *p0* in other fields. If you provide an operator name for the enum,
  such as *priority*, then search users can use that operator to refine
  results to only items that have *p0* as this property's value, with the
  query *priority:p0*.

  ## Attributes

  *   `operatorName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the
      enum property. For example, if operatorName is *priority* and the
      property's name is *priorityVal*, then queries like
      *priority:&lt;value&gt;* show results only where the value of the
      property named *priorityVal* matches *&lt;value&gt;*. By contrast, a
      search that uses the same *&lt;value&gt;* without an operator returns
      all items where *&lt;value&gt;* matches the value of any String
      properties or text within the content field for the item.
      The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z).
      The maximum length is 32 characters.
