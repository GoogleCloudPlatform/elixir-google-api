defmodule GoogleApi.Language.V1.Model.Entity do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a phrase in the text that is a known entity, such as a person, an organization, or location. The API associates information, such as salience and mentions, with entities.

  ## Attributes

  - mentions ([EntityMention]): The mentions of this entity in the input document. The API currently supports proper noun mentions. Defaults to: `null`.
  - metadata (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Metadata associated with the entity.  Currently, Wikipedia URLs and Knowledge Graph MIDs are provided, if available. The associated keys are \&quot;wikipedia_url\&quot; and \&quot;mid\&quot;, respectively. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The representative name for the entity. Defaults to: `null`.
  - salience (float()): The salience score associated with the entity in the [0, 1.0] range.  The salience score for an entity provides information about the importance or centrality of that entity to the entire document text. Scores closer to 0 are less salient, while scores closer to 1.0 are highly salient. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sentiment (Sentiment): For calls to AnalyzeEntitySentiment or if AnnotateTextRequest.Features.extract_entity_sentiment is set to true, this field will contain the aggregate sentiment expressed for this entity in the provided document. Defaults to: `null`.
  - type (String.t): The entity type. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, EVENT, WORK_OF_ART, CONSUMER_GOOD, OTHER]
