defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.EnrollmentToken do
  @moduledoc """
  An enrollment token.

  ## Attributes

  - additionalData (String): Optional, arbitrary data associated with the enrollment token. This could contain, for example, the id of an org unit to which the device is assigned after enrollment. After a device enrolls with the token, this data will be exposed in the enrollment_token_data field of the Device resource. The data must be 1024 characters or less; otherwise, the creation request will fail. Defaults to: `null`.
  - duration (String): The duration of the token. If not specified, the duration will be 1 hour. The allowed range is 1 minute to 30 days. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expirationTimestamp (String): The expiration time of the token. This is a read-only field generated by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The name of the enrollment token, which is generated by the server during creation, in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/enrollmentTokens/{enrollmentTokenId} Defaults to: `null`.
  - policyName (String): The name of the policy that will be initially applied to the enrolled device in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/policies/{policyId}. If not specified, the policy with id default is applied. It is permissible to only specify the policyId when updating this field as long as the policyId contains no slashes since the rest of the policy name can be inferred from context. Defaults to: `null`.
  - qrCode (String): A JSON string whose UTF-8 representation can be used to generate a QR code to enroll a device with this enrollment token. To enroll a device using NFC, the NFC record must contain a serialized java.util.Properties representation of the properties in the JSON. Defaults to: `null`.
  - value (String): The token value which is passed to the device and authorizes the device to enroll. This is a read-only field generated by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
