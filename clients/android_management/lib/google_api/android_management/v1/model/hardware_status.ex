defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.HardwareStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  Hardware status. Temperatures may be compared to the temperature thresholds available in hardwareInfo to determine hardware health.

  ## Attributes

  - batteryTemperatures (List[Float]): Current battery temperatures in Celsius for each battery on the device. Defaults to: `null`.
  - cpuTemperatures (List[Float]): Current CPU temperatures in Celsius for each CPU on the device. Defaults to: `null`.
  - cpuUsages (List[Float]): CPU usages in percentage for each core available on the device. Usage is 0 for each unplugged core. Empty array implies that CPU usage is not supported in the system. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createTime (String): The time the measurements were taken. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fanSpeeds (List[Float]): Fan speeds in RPM for each fan on the device. Empty array means that there are no fans or fan speed is not supported on the system. Defaults to: `null`.
  - gpuTemperatures (List[Float]): Current GPU temperatures in Celsius for each GPU on the device. Defaults to: `null`.
  - skinTemperatures (List[Float]): Current device skin temperatures in Celsius. Defaults to: `null`.
