defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.KeyedAppState do
  @moduledoc """
  Keyed app state reported by the app.

  ## Attributes

  - createTime (DateTime.t): The creation time of the app state on the device. Defaults to: `null`.
  - data (String.t): Optionally, a machine-readable value to be read by the EMM. For example, setting values that the admin can choose to query against in the EMM console (e.g. “notify me if the battery_warning data &lt; 10”). Defaults to: `null`.
  - key (String.t): The key for the app state. Acts as a point of reference for what the app is providing state for. For example, when providing managed configuration feedback, this key could be the managed configuration key. Defaults to: `null`.
  - lastUpdateTime (DateTime.t): The time the app state was most recently updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - message (String.t): Optionally, a free-form message string to explain the app state. If the state was triggered by a particular value (e.g. a managed configuration value), it should be included in the message. Defaults to: `null`.
  - severity (String.t): The severity of the app state. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [SEVERITY_UNSPECIFIED, INFO, ERROR]
