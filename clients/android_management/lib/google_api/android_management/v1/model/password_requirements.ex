defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.PasswordRequirements do
  @moduledoc """
  Requirements for the password used to unlock a device.

  ## Attributes

  - maximumFailedPasswordsForWipe (Integer): A device will be wiped after too many incorrect device-unlock passwords have been entered. A value of 0 means there is no restriction. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordExpirationTimeout (String): Password expiration timeout. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordHistoryLength (Integer): The length of the password history. After setting this, the user will not be able to enter a new password that is the same as any password in the history. A value of 0 means there is no restriction. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumLength (Integer): The minimum allowed password length. A value of 0 means there is no restriction. Only enforced when password_quality is NUMERIC, NUMERIC_COMPLEX, ALPHABETIC, ALPHANUMERIC, or COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumLetters (Integer): Minimum number of letters required in the password. Only enforced when password_quality is COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumLowerCase (Integer): Minimum number of lower case letters required in the password. Only enforced when password_quality is COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumNonLetter (Integer): Minimum number of non-letter characters (numerical digits or symbols) required in the password. Only enforced when password_quality is COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumNumeric (Integer): Minimum number of numerical digits required in the password. Only enforced when password_quality is COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumSymbols (Integer): Minimum number of symbols required in the password. Only enforced when password_quality is COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordMinimumUpperCase (Integer): Minimum number of upper case letters required in the password. Only enforced when password_quality is COMPLEX. Defaults to: `null`.
  - passwordQuality (String): The required password quality. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED, SOMETHING, NUMERIC, NUMERIC_COMPLEX, ALPHABETIC, ALPHANUMERIC, COMPLEX]
