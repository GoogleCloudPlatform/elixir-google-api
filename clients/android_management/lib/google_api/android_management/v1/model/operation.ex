defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.Operation do
  @moduledoc """
  This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  ## Attributes

  - done (boolean()): If the value is false, it means the operation is still in progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either error or response is available. Defaults to: `null`.
  - error (Status): The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - metadata (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should have the format of operations/some/unique/name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - response (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is google.protobuf.Empty. If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot(), the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse. Defaults to: `null`.
