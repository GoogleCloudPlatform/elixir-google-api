defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidManagement.V1.Model.NonComplianceDetailCondition do
  @moduledoc """
  A compliance rule condition which is satisfied if there exists any matching NonComplianceDetail for the device. A NonComplianceDetail matches a NonComplianceDetailCondition if all the fields which are set within the NonComplianceDetailCondition match the corresponding NonComplianceDetail fields.

  ## Attributes

  - nonComplianceReason (String): The reason the device is not in compliance with the setting. If not set, then this condition matches any reason. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [NON_COMPLIANCE_REASON_UNSPECIFIED, API_LEVEL, ADMIN_TYPE, USER_ACTION, INVALID_VALUE, APP_NOT_INSTALLED, UNSUPPORTED, APP_INSTALLED, PENDING, APP_INCOMPATIBLE]
  - packageName (String): The package name indicating which application is out of compliance. If not set, then this condition matches any package name. If this field is set, then setting_name must be unset or set to applications; otherwise, the condition would never be satisfied. Defaults to: `null`.
  - settingName (String): The name of the policy setting. This is the JSON field name of a top-level Policy field. If not set, then this condition matches any setting name. Defaults to: `null`.
