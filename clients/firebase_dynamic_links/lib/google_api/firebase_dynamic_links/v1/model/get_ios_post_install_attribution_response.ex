defmodule GoogleApi.FirebaseDynamicLinks.V1.Model.GetIosPostInstallAttributionResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  Response for iSDK to execute strong match flow for post-install attribution.

  ## Attributes

  - appMinimumVersion (String.t): The minimum version for app, specified by dev through ?imv&#x3D; parameter. Return to iSDK to allow app to evaluate if current version meets this. Defaults to: `null`.
  - attributionConfidence (String.t): The confidence of the returned attribution. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTION_CONFIDENCE, WEAK, DEFAULT, UNIQUE]
  - deepLink (String.t): The deep-link attributed post-install via one of several techniques (fingerprint, copy unique). Defaults to: `null`.
  - externalBrowserDestinationLink (String.t): User-agent specific custom-scheme URIs for iSDK to open. This will be set according to the user-agent tha the click was originally made in. There is no Safari-equivalent custom-scheme open URLs. ie: googlechrome://www.example.com ie: firefox://open-url?url&#x3D;http://www.example.com ie: opera-http://example.com Defaults to: `null`.
  - fallbackLink (String.t): The link to navigate to update the app if min version is not met. This is either (in order): 1) fallback link (from ?ifl&#x3D; parameter, if specified by developer) or 2) AppStore URL (from ?isi&#x3D; parameter, if specified), or 3) the payload link (from required link&#x3D; parameter). Defaults to: `null`.
  - invitationId (String.t): Invitation ID attributed post-install via one of several techniques (fingerprint, copy unique). Defaults to: `null`.
  - isStrongMatchExecutable (boolean()): Instruction for iSDK to attemmpt to perform strong match. For instance, if browser does not support/allow cookie or outside of support browsers, this will be false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchMessage (String.t): Describes why match failed, ie: \&quot;discarded due to low confidence\&quot;. This message will be publicly visible. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestIpVersion (String.t): Which IP version the request was made from. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN_IP_VERSION, IP_V4, IP_V6]
  - requestedLink (String.t): Entire FDL (short or long) attributed post-install via one of several techniques (fingerprint, copy unique). Defaults to: `null`.
  - resolvedLink (String.t): The entire FDL, expanded from a short link. It is the same as the requested_link, if it is long. Parameters from this should not be used directly (ie: server can default utm_[campaign|medium|source] to a value when requested_link lack them, server determine the best fallback_link when requested_link specifies &gt;1 fallback links). Defaults to: `null`.
  - utmCampaign (String.t): Scion campaign value to be propagated by iSDK to Scion at post-install. Defaults to: `null`.
  - utmContent (String.t): Scion content value to be propagated by iSDK to Scion at app-reopen. Defaults to: `null`.
  - utmMedium (String.t): Scion medium value to be propagated by iSDK to Scion at post-install. Defaults to: `null`.
  - utmSource (String.t): Scion source value to be propagated by iSDK to Scion at post-install. Defaults to: `null`.
  - utmTerm (String.t): Scion term value to be propagated by iSDK to Scion at app-reopen. Defaults to: `null`.
