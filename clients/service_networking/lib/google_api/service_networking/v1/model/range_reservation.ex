  Represents a range reservation.

  ## Attributes

  *   `ipPrefixLength` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The size of the desired subnet. Use usual CIDR range notation. For example,
      '30' to find unused x.x.x.x/30 CIDR range. The goal is to determine if one
      of the allocated ranges has enough free space for a subnet of the requested
      size.
