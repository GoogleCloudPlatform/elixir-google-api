defmodule GoogleApi.YouTube.V3.Model.CommentThreadSnippet do
  @moduledoc """
  Basic details about a comment thread.

  ## Attributes

  - canReply (boolean()): Whether the current viewer of the thread can reply to it. This is viewer specific - other viewers may see a different value for this field. Defaults to: `null`.
  - channelId (String.t): The YouTube channel the comments in the thread refer to or the channel with the video the comments refer to. If video_id isn&#39;t set the comments refer to the channel itself. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isPublic (boolean()): Whether the thread (and therefore all its comments) is visible to all YouTube users. Defaults to: `null`.
  - topLevelComment (Comment): The top level comment of this thread. Defaults to: `null`.
  - totalReplyCount (integer()): The total number of replies (not including the top level comment). Defaults to: `null`.
  - videoId (String.t): The ID of the video the comments refer to, if any. No video_id implies a channel discussion comment. Defaults to: `null`.
