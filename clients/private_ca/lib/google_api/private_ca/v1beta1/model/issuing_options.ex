  Options that affect all certificates issued by a CertificateAuthority.

  ## Attributes

  *   `includeCaCertUrl` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. When true, includes a URL to the issuing CA certificate in the "authority information access" X.509 extension.
  *   `includeCrlAccessUrl` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. When true, includes a URL to the CRL corresponding to certificates issued from a CertificateAuthority.
