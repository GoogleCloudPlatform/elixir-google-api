defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.DimensionFilter do
  @moduledoc """
  Dimension filter specifies the filtering options on a dimension.

  ## Attributes

  - caseSensitive (Boolean): Should the match be case sensitive? Default is false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dimensionName (String): The dimension to filter on. A DimensionFilter must contain a dimension. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expressions (List[String]): Strings or regular expression to match against. Only the first value of the list is used for comparison unless the operator is &#x60;IN_LIST&#x60;. If &#x60;IN_LIST&#x60; operator, then the entire list is used to filter the dimensions as explained in the description of the &#x60;IN_LIST&#x60; operator. Defaults to: `null`.
  - not (Boolean): Logical &#x60;NOT&#x60; operator. If this boolean is set to true, then the matching dimension values will be excluded in the report. The default is false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - operator (String): How to match the dimension to the expression. The default is REGEXP. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [OPERATOR_UNSPECIFIED, REGEXP, BEGINS_WITH, ENDS_WITH, PARTIAL, EXACT, NUMERIC_EQUAL, NUMERIC_GREATER_THAN, NUMERIC_LESS_THAN, IN_LIST]
