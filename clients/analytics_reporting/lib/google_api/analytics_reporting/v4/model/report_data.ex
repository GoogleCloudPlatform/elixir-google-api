defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.ReportData do
  @moduledoc """
  The data part of the report.

  ## Attributes

  - dataLastRefreshed (String): The last time the data in the report was refreshed. All the hits received before this timestamp are included in the calculation of the report. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isDataGolden (Boolean): Indicates if response to this request is golden or not. Data is golden when the exact same request will not produce any new results if asked at a later point in time. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maximums (List[DateRangeValues]): Minimum and maximum values seen over all matching rows. These are both empty when &#x60;hideValueRanges&#x60; in the request is false, or when rowCount is zero. Defaults to: `null`.
  - minimums (List[DateRangeValues]): Minimum and maximum values seen over all matching rows. These are both empty when &#x60;hideValueRanges&#x60; in the request is false, or when rowCount is zero. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rowCount (Integer): Total number of matching rows for this query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rows (List[ReportRow]): There&#39;s one ReportRow for every unique combination of dimensions. Defaults to: `null`.
  - samplesReadCounts (List[String]): If the results are [sampled](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192), this returns the total number of samples read, one entry per date range. If the results are not sampled this field will not be defined. See [developer guide](/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/basics#sampling) for details. Defaults to: `null`.
  - samplingSpaceSizes (List[String]): If the results are [sampled](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192), this returns the total number of samples present, one entry per date range. If the results are not sampled this field will not be defined. See [developer guide](/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/basics#sampling) for details. Defaults to: `null`.
  - totals (List[DateRangeValues]): For each requested date range, for the set of all rows that match the query, every requested value format gets a total. The total for a value format is computed by first totaling the metrics mentioned in the value format and then evaluating the value format as a scalar expression.  E.g., The \&quot;totals\&quot; for &#x60;3 / (ga:sessions + 2)&#x60; we compute &#x60;3 / ((sum of all relevant ga:sessions) + 2)&#x60;. Totals are computed before pagination. Defaults to: `null`.
