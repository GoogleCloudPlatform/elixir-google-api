defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsReporting.V4.Model.SegmentFilter do
  @moduledoc """
  SegmentFilter defines the segment to be either a simple or a sequence segment. A simple segment condition contains dimension and metric conditions to select the sessions or users. A sequence segment condition can be used to select users or sessions based on sequential conditions.

  ## Attributes

  - not (Boolean): If true, match the complement of simple or sequence segment. For example, to match all visits not from \&quot;New York\&quot;, we can define the segment as follows:        \&quot;sessionSegment\&quot;: {         \&quot;segmentFilters\&quot;: [{           \&quot;simpleSegment\&quot; :{             \&quot;orFiltersForSegment\&quot;: [{               \&quot;segmentFilterClauses\&quot;:[{                 \&quot;dimensionFilter\&quot;: {                   \&quot;dimensionName\&quot;: \&quot;ga:city\&quot;,                   \&quot;expressions\&quot;: [\&quot;New York\&quot;]                 }               }]             }]           },           \&quot;not\&quot;: \&quot;True\&quot;         }]       }, Defaults to: `null`.
  - sequenceSegment (SequenceSegment): Sequence conditions consist of one or more steps, where each step is defined by one or more dimension/metric conditions. Multiple steps can be combined with special sequence operators. Defaults to: `null`.
  - simpleSegment (SimpleSegment): A Simple segment conditions consist of one or more dimension/metric conditions that can be combined Defaults to: `null`.
