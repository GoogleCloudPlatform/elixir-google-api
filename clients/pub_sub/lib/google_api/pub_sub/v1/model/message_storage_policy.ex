  ## Attributes

  - allowedPersistenceRegions (list(String.t)): The list of GCP region IDs where messages that are published to the topic
  may be persisted in storage. Messages published by publishers running in
  non-allowed GCP regions (or running outside of GCP altogether) will be
  routed for storage in one of the allowed regions. An empty list indicates a
  misconfiguration at the project or organization level, which will result in
  all Publish operations failing. Defaults to `nil`.
