defmodule GoogleApi.PageSpeedOnline.V4.Model.PagespeedApiPagespeedResponseV4FormattedResultsRuleResults do
  @moduledoc """
  The enum-like identifier for this rule. For instance \&quot;EnableKeepAlive\&quot; or \&quot;AvoidCssImport\&quot;. Not localized.

  ## Attributes

  - beta (boolean()): Whether this rule is in &#39;beta&#39;. Rules in beta are new rules that are being tested, which do not impact the overall score. Defaults to: `null`.
  - groups ([String.t]): List of rule groups that this rule belongs to. Each entry in the list is one of \&quot;SPEED\&quot;, \&quot;USABILITY\&quot;, or \&quot;SECURITY\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - localizedRuleName (String.t): Localized name of the rule, intended for presentation to a user. Defaults to: `null`.
  - ruleImpact (float()): The impact (unbounded floating point value) that implementing the suggestions for this rule would have on making the page faster. Impact is comparable between rules to determine which rule&#39;s suggestions would have a higher or lower impact on making a page faster. For instance, if enabling compression would save 1MB, while optimizing images would save 500kB, the enable compression rule would have 2x the impact of the image optimization rule, all other things being equal. Defaults to: `null`.
  - summary (PagespeedApiFormatStringV4): A brief summary description for the rule, indicating at a high level what should be done to follow the rule and what benefit can be gained by doing so. Defaults to: `null`.
  - urlBlocks ([PagespeedApiPagespeedResponseV4FormattedResultsUrlBlocks]): List of blocks of URLs. Each block may contain a heading and a list of URLs. Each URL may optionally include additional details. Defaults to: `null`.
