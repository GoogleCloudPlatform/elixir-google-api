defmodule GoogleApi.NetworkManagement.V1beta1.Model.Endpoint do
  @moduledoc """
  Source or destination of the Connectivity Test.

  ## Attributes

  *   `instance` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A Compute Engine instance URI.
  *   `ipAddress` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The IP address of the endpoint, which can be an external or internal IP.
      An IPv6 address is only allowed when the test's destination is a
      [global load balancer VIP](/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview).
  *   `network` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A Compute Engine network URI.
  *   `networkType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Type of the network where the endpoint is located.
      Applicable only to source endpoint, as destination network type can be
      inferred from the source.
  *   `port` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The IP protocol port of the endpoint.
      Only applicable when protocol is TCP or UDP.
  *   `projectId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Project ID where the endpoint is located.
      The Project ID can be derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or
      network URI.
      The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:
      1. Only the IP address is specified, and the IP address is within a GCP
      project.
      2. When you are using Shared VPC and the IP address that you provide is
      from the service project. In this case, the network that the IP address
      resides in is defined in the host project.
