  The request to populate a Version's Files.

  ## Attributes

  *   `files` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - A set of file paths to the hashes corresponding to assets that should be
      added to the version. Note that a file path to an empty hash will remove
      the path from the version. Calculate a hash by Gzipping the file then
      taking the SHA256 hash of the newly compressed file.
