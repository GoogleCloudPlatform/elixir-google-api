defmodule GoogleApi.Fitness.V1.Model.Session do
  @moduledoc """
  Sessions contain metadata, such as a user-friendly name and time interval information.

  ## Attributes

  - activeTimeMillis (String): Session active time. While start_time_millis and end_time_millis define the full session time, the active time can be shorter and specified by active_time_millis. If the inactive time during the session is known, it should also be inserted via a com.google.activity.segment data point with a STILL activity value Defaults to: `null`.
  - activityType (Integer): The type of activity this session represents. Defaults to: `null`.
  - application (Application): The application that created the session. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String): A description for this session. Defaults to: `null`.
  - endTimeMillis (String): An end time, in milliseconds since epoch, inclusive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String): A client-generated identifier that is unique across all sessions owned by this particular user. Defaults to: `null`.
  - modifiedTimeMillis (String): A timestamp that indicates when the session was last modified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): A human readable name of the session. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTimeMillis (String): A start time, in milliseconds since epoch, inclusive. Defaults to: `null`.
