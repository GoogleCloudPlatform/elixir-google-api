defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.StructuredQuery do
  @moduledoc """
  A Firestore query.

  ## Attributes

  - endAt (Cursor): A end point for the query results. Defaults to: `null`.
  - from ([CollectionSelector]): The collections to query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - limit (integer()): The maximum number of results to return.  Applies after all other constraints. Must be &gt;&#x3D; 0 if specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - offset (integer()): The number of results to skip.  Applies before limit, but after all other constraints. Must be &gt;&#x3D; 0 if specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - orderBy ([Order]): The order to apply to the query results.  Firestore guarantees a stable ordering through the following rules:   * Any field required to appear in &#x60;order_by&#x60;, that is not already    specified in &#x60;order_by&#x60;, is appended to the order in field name order    by default.  * If an order on &#x60;__name__&#x60; is not specified, it is appended by default.  Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last order specified, or &#39;ASCENDING&#39; if no order was specified. For example:   * &#x60;SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A&#x60; becomes    &#x60;SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A, __name__&#x60;  * &#x60;SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A DESC&#x60; becomes    &#x60;SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A DESC, __name__ DESC&#x60;  * &#x60;SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE A &gt; 1&#x60; becomes    &#x60;SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE A &gt; 1 ORDER BY A, __name__&#x60; Defaults to: `null`.
  - select (Projection): The projection to return. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startAt (Cursor): A starting point for the query results. Defaults to: `null`.
  - where (Filter): The filter to apply. Defaults to: `null`.
