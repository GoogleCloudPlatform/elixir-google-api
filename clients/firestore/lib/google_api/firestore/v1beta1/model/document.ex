defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1beta1.Model.Document do
  @moduledoc """
  A Firestore document.  Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.

  ## Attributes

  - createTime (String.t): Output only. The time at which the document was created.  This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the &#x60;read_time&#x60; of a query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fields (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; Value}): The document&#39;s fields.  The map keys represent field names.  A simple field name contains only characters &#x60;a&#x60; to &#x60;z&#x60;, &#x60;A&#x60; to &#x60;Z&#x60;, &#x60;0&#x60; to &#x60;9&#x60;, or &#x60;_&#x60;, and must not start with &#x60;0&#x60; to &#x60;9&#x60;. For example, &#x60;foo_bar_17&#x60;.  Field names matching the regular expression &#x60;__.*__&#x60; are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty.  Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For &#x60;map_value&#x60;, the field path is represented by the simple or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by &#x60;.&#x60;. For example, the structured field &#x60;\&quot;foo\&quot; : { map_value: { \&quot;x&amp;y\&quot; : { string_value: \&quot;hello\&quot; }}}&#x60; would be represented by the field path &#x60;foo.x&amp;y&#x60;.  Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with &#x60;&#x60; &#x60; &#x60;&#x60; and may contain any character. Some characters, including &#x60;&#x60; &#x60; &#x60;&#x60;, must be escaped using a &#x60;\\&#x60;. For example, &#x60;&#x60; &#x60;x&amp;y&#x60; &#x60;&#x60; represents &#x60;x&amp;y&#x60; and &#x60;&#x60; &#x60;bak\\&#x60;tik&#x60; &#x60;&#x60; represents &#x60;&#x60; bak&#x60;tik &#x60;&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The resource name of the document, for example &#x60;projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - updateTime (String.t): Output only. The time at which the document was last changed.  This value is initially set to the &#x60;create_time&#x60; then increases monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the &#x60;read_time&#x60; of a query. Defaults to: `null`.
