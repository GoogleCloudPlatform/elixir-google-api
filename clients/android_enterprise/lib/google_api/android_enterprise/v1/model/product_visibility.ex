defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.ProductVisibility do
  @moduledoc """
  A product to be made visible to a user.

  ## Attributes

  - productId (String.t): The product ID to make visible to the user. Required for each item in the productVisibility list. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tracks ([String.t]): Grants visibility to the specified track(s) of the product to the user. The track available to the user is based on the following order of preference: alpha, beta, production. For example, if an app has a prod version, a beta version and an alpha version and the enterprise has been granted visibility to both the alpha and beta tracks, if tracks is {\&quot;beta\&quot;, \&quot;production\&quot;} the user will be able to install the app and they will get the beta version of the app. If there are no app versions in the specified track adding the \&quot;alpha\&quot; and \&quot;beta\&quot; values to the list of tracks will have no effect. Note that the enterprise requires access to alpha and/or beta tracks before users can be granted visibility to apps in those tracks.  The allowed sets are: {} (considered equivalent to {\&quot;production\&quot;}) {\&quot;production\&quot;} {\&quot;beta\&quot;, \&quot;production\&quot;} {\&quot;alpha\&quot;, \&quot;beta\&quot;, \&quot;production\&quot;} The order of elements is not relevant. Any other set of tracks will be rejected with an error. Defaults to: `null`.
