  @moduledoc """
  Represents a keyed app state containing a key, timestamp, severity level, optional description, and optional data.

  ## Attributes

  - data (String.t): Additional field intended for machine-readable data. For example, a number or JSON object. To prevent XSS, we recommend removing any HTML from the data before displaying it. Defaults to: `null`.
  - key (String.t): Key indicating what the app is providing a state for. The content of the key is set by the app&#39;s developer. To prevent XSS, we recommend removing any HTML from the key before displaying it. This field will always be present. Defaults to: `null`.
  - message (String.t): Free-form, human-readable message describing the app state. For example, an error message. To prevent XSS, we recommend removing any HTML from the message before displaying it. Defaults to: `null`.
  - severity (String.t): Severity of the app state. This field will always be present. Defaults to: `null`.
  - stateTimestampMillis (String.t): Timestamp of when the app set the state in milliseconds since epoch. This field will always be present. Defaults to: `null`.
