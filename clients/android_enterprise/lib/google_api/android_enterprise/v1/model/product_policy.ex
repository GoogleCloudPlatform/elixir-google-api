defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.ProductPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The policy for a product.

  ## Attributes

  - productId (String.t): The ID of the product. For example, \&quot;app:com.google.android.gm\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tracks ([String.t]): Grants visibility to the specified track(s) of the product to the device. The track available to the device is based on the following order of preference: alpha, beta, production. For example, if an app has a prod version, a beta version and an alpha version and the enterprise has been granted visibility to both the alpha and beta tracks, if tracks is {\&quot;beta\&quot;, \&quot;production\&quot;} then the beta version of the app is made available to the device. If there are no app versions in the specified track adding the \&quot;alpha\&quot; and \&quot;beta\&quot; values to the list of tracks will have no effect. Note that the enterprise requires access to alpha and/or beta tracks before users can be granted visibility to apps in those tracks.  The allowed sets are: {} (considered equivalent to {\&quot;production\&quot;}) {\&quot;production\&quot;} {\&quot;beta\&quot;, \&quot;production\&quot;} {\&quot;alpha\&quot;, \&quot;beta\&quot;, \&quot;production\&quot;} The order of elements is not relevant. Any other set of tracks will be rejected with an error. Defaults to: `null`.
