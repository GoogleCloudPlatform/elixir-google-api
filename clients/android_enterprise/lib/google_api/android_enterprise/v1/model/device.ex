defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.Device do
  @moduledoc """
  A Devices resource represents a mobile device managed by the EMM and belonging to a specific enterprise user.  This collection cannot be modified via the API. It is automatically populated as devices are set up to be managed.

  ## Attributes

  - androidId (String): The Google Play Services Android ID for the device encoded as a lowercase hex string. For example, \&quot;123456789abcdef0\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string \&quot;androidenterprise#device\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - managementType (String): Identifies the extent to which the device is controlled by a managed Google Play EMM in various deployment configurations.  Possible values include:  - \&quot;managedDevice\&quot;, a device that has the EMM&#39;s device policy controller (DPC) as the device owner.  - \&quot;managedProfile\&quot;, a device that has a profile managed by the DPC (DPC is profile owner) in addition to a separate, personal profile that is unavailable to the DPC.  - \&quot;containerApp\&quot;, no longer used (deprecated).  - \&quot;unmanagedProfile\&quot;, a device that has been allowed (by the domain&#39;s admin, using the Admin Console to enable the privilege) to use managed Google Play, but the profile is itself not owned by a DPC. Defaults to: `null`.
