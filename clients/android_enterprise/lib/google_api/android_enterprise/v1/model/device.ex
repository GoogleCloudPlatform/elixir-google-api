defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.Device do
  @moduledoc """
  A Devices resource represents a mobile device managed by the EMM and belonging to a specific enterprise user.

  ## Attributes

  - androidId (String.t): The Google Play Services Android ID for the device encoded as a lowercase hex string. For example, "123456789abcdef0". Defaults to `nil`.
  - kind (String.t): Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "androidenterprise#device". Defaults to `androidenterprise#device`.
  - managementType (String.t): Identifies the extent to which the device is controlled by a managed Google Play EMM in various deployment configurations.

  Possible values include: 
  - "managedDevice", a device that has the EMM's device policy controller (DPC) as the device owner. 
  - "managedProfile", a device that has a profile managed by the DPC (DPC is profile owner) in addition to a separate, personal profile that is unavailable to the DPC. 
  - "containerApp", no longer used (deprecated). 
  - "unmanagedProfile", a device that has been allowed (by the domain's admin, using the Admin Console to enable the privilege) to use managed Google Play, but the profile is itself not owned by a DPC. Defaults to `nil`.
  - policy (GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.Policy.t): The policy enforced on the device. Defaults to `nil`.
  - report (GoogleApi.AndroidEnterprise.V1.Model.DeviceReport.t): The device report updated with the latest app states. Defaults to `nil`.
