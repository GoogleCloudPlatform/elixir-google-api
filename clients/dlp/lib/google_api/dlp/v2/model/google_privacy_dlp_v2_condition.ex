  The field type of &#x60;value&#x60; and &#x60;field&#x60; do not need to match to be considered equal, but not all comparisons are possible.  A &#x60;value&#x60; of type:  - &#x60;string&#x60; can be compared against all other types - &#x60;boolean&#x60; can only be compared against other booleans - &#x60;integer&#x60; can be compared against doubles or a string if the string value can be parsed as an integer. - &#x60;double&#x60; can be compared against integers or a string if the string can be parsed as a double. - &#x60;Timestamp&#x60; can be compared against strings in RFC 3339 date string format. - &#x60;TimeOfDay&#x60; can be compared against timestamps and strings in the format of &#39;HH:mm:ss&#39;.  If we fail to compare do to type mismatch, a warning will be given and the condition will evaluate to false.

  ## Attributes

  - field (GooglePrivacyDlpV2FieldId): Field within the record this condition is evaluated against. [required] Defaults to: `null`.
  - operator (String.t): Operator used to compare the field or infoType to the value. [required] Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [RELATIONAL_OPERATOR_UNSPECIFIED, EQUAL_TO, NOT_EQUAL_TO, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, EXISTS]
  - value (GooglePrivacyDlpV2Value): Value to compare against. [Required, except for &#x60;EXISTS&#x60; tests.] Defaults to: `null`.
