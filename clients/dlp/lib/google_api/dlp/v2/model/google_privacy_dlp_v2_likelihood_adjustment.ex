defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2LikelihoodAdjustment do
  @moduledoc """
  Message for specifying an adjustment to the likelihood of a finding as part of a detection rule.

  ## Attributes

  - fixedLikelihood (String.t): Set the likelihood of a finding to a fixed value. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [LIKELIHOOD_UNSPECIFIED, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - relativeLikelihood (integer()): Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example, if a finding would be &#x60;POSSIBLE&#x60; without the detection rule and &#x60;relative_likelihood&#x60; is 1, then it is upgraded to &#x60;LIKELY&#x60;, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to &#x60;UNLIKELY&#x60;. Likelihood may never drop below &#x60;VERY_UNLIKELY&#x60; or exceed &#x60;VERY_LIKELY&#x60;, so applying an adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is &#x60;VERY_LIKELY&#x60; will result in a final likelihood of &#x60;LIKELY&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
