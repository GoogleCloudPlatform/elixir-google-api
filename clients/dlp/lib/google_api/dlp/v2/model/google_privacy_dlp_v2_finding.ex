defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GooglePrivacyDlpV2Finding do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a piece of potentially sensitive content.

  ## Attributes

  - createTime (DateTime.t): Timestamp when finding was detected. Defaults to: `null`.
  - infoType (GooglePrivacyDlpV2InfoType): The type of content that might have been found. Provided if &#x60;excluded_types&#x60; is false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - likelihood (String.t): Confidence of how likely it is that the &#x60;info_type&#x60; is correct. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [LIKELIHOOD_UNSPECIFIED, VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, VERY_LIKELY]
  - location (GooglePrivacyDlpV2Location): Where the content was found. Defaults to: `null`.
  - quote (String.t): The content that was found. Even if the content is not textual, it may be converted to a textual representation here. Provided if &#x60;include_quote&#x60; is true and the finding is less than or equal to 4096 bytes long. If the finding exceeds 4096 bytes in length, the quote may be omitted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - quoteInfo (GooglePrivacyDlpV2QuoteInfo): Contains data parsed from quotes. Only populated if include_quote was set to true and a supported infoType was requested. Currently supported infoTypes: DATE, DATE_OF_BIRTH and TIME. Defaults to: `null`.
