  ## Attributes

  - explicitMarketingPreference (String.t): Last known user selection regarding marketing preferences. In certain cases this selection might not be known, so this field would be empty. Defaults to: `null`.
  - lastUpdatedTimestamp (String.t): Timestamp when last time marketing preference was updated. Could be empty, if user wasn&#39;t offered a selection yet. Defaults to: `null`.
  - marketingEmailAddress (String.t): Email address that can be used for marketing purposes. This field is only filled when explicitMarketingPreference is equal to &#39;granted&#39;. Defaults to: `null`.
