defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.TrafficTarget do
  @moduledoc """
  TrafficTarget holds a single entry of the routing table for a Route.

  ## Attributes

  - configurationName (String.t): ConfigurationName of a configuration to whose latest revision we will
  send this portion of traffic. When the "status.latestReadyRevisionName"
  of the referenced configuration changes, we will automatically migrate
  traffic from the prior "latest ready" revision to the new one. This field
  is never set in Route's status, only its spec. This is mutually exclusive
  with RevisionName.

  Cloud Run currently supports a single ConfigurationName. Defaults to `nil`.
  - latestRevision (boolean()): LatestRevision may be optionally provided to indicate that the latest
  ready Revision of the Configuration should be used for this traffic
  target. When provided LatestRevision must be true if RevisionName is
  empty; it must be false when RevisionName is non-empty.

  Not currently supported in Cloud Run.
  +optional Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Name is optionally used to expose a dedicated hostname for referencing this
  target exclusively.

  Not currently supported by Cloud Run.
  +optional Defaults to `nil`.
  - percent (integer()): Percent specifies percent of the traffic to this Revision or Configuration.
  This defaults to zero if unspecified.

  Cloud Run currently requires 100 percent for a single ConfigurationName
  TrafficTarget entry. Defaults to `nil`.
  - revisionName (String.t): RevisionName of a specific revision to which to send this portion of
  traffic. This is mutually exclusive with ConfigurationName.

  Providing RevisionName in spec is not currently supported by Cloud Run. Defaults to `nil`.
  - tag (String.t): Tag is optionally used to expose a dedicated url for referencing
  this target exclusively.

  Not currently supported in Cloud Run.
  +optional Defaults to `nil`.
  - url (String.t): Output only. URL displays the URL for accessing named traffic targets. URL
  is displayed in status, and is disallowed on spec. URL must contain a
  scheme (e.g. http://) and a hostname, but may not contain anything else
  (e.g. basic auth, url path, etc.

  Not currently supported in Cloud Run. Defaults to `nil`.
