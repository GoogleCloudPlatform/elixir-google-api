defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.ObjectReference do
  @moduledoc """
  ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.

  ## Attributes

  - apiVersion (String.t): API version of the referent. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - fieldPath (String.t): If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: \&quot;spec.containers{name}\&quot; (where \&quot;name\&quot; refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified \&quot;spec.containers[2]\&quot; (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - namespace (String.t): Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - resourceVersion (String.t): Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - uid (String.t): UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids +optional Defaults to: `null`.
