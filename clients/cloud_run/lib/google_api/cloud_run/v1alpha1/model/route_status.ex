defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.RouteStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  RouteStatus communicates the observed state of the Route (from the
  controller).

  ## Attributes

  - address (GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.Addressable.t): Similar to domain, information on where the service is available on HTTP. Defaults to `nil`.
  - conditions (list(GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.RouteCondition.t)): Conditions communicates information about ongoing/complete
  reconciliation processes that bring the "spec" inline with the observed
  state of the world. Defaults to `nil`.
  - domain (String.t): Domain holds the top-level domain that will distribute traffic over the
  provided targets. It generally has the form
  https://{route-hash}-{project-hash}-{cluster-level-suffix}.a.run.app Defaults to `nil`.
  - domainInternal (String.t): For Cloud Run, identifical to domain. Defaults to `nil`.
  - observedGeneration (integer()): ObservedGeneration is the 'Generation' of the Route that
  was last processed by the controller.

  Clients polling for completed reconciliation should poll until
  observedGeneration = metadata.generation and the Ready condition's status
  is True or False.

  Note that providing a trafficTarget that only has a configurationName will
  result in a Route that does not increment either its metadata.generation or
  its observedGeneration, as new "latest ready" revisions from the
  Configuration are processed without an update to the Route's spec. Defaults to `nil`.
  - traffic (list(GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.TrafficTarget.t)): Traffic holds the configured traffic distribution.
  These entries will always contain RevisionName references.
  When ConfigurationName appears in the spec, this will hold the
  LatestReadyRevisionName that we last observed. Defaults to `nil`.
