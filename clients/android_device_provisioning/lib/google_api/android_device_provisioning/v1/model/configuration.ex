defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidDeviceProvisioning.V1.Model.Configuration do
  @moduledoc """
  A configuration collects the provisioning options for Android devices. Each configuration combines the following:  * The EMM device policy controller (DPC) installed on the devices. * EMM policies enforced on the devices. * Metadata displayed on the device to help users during setup.  Customers can add as many configurations as they need. However, zero-touch enrollment works best when a customer sets a default configuration that&#39;s applied to any new devices the organization purchases.

  ## Attributes

  - companyName (String.t): Required. The name of the organization. Zero-touch enrollment shows this organization name to device users during device provisioning. Defaults to: `null`.
  - configurationId (String.t): Output only. The ID of the configuration. Assigned by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - configurationName (String.t): Required. A short name that describes the configuration&#39;s purpose. For example, _Sales team_ or _Temporary employees_. The zero-touch enrollment portal displays this name to IT admins. Defaults to: `null`.
  - contactEmail (String.t): Required. The email address that device users can contact to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this email address to device users before device provisioning. The value is validated on input. Defaults to: `null`.
  - contactPhone (String.t): Required. The telephone number that device users can call, using another device, to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this number to device users before device provisioning. Accepts numerals, spaces, the plus sign, hyphens, and parentheses. Defaults to: `null`.
  - customMessage (String.t): A message, containing one or two sentences, to help device users get help or give them more details about whatâ€™s happening to their device. Zero-touch enrollment shows this message before the device is provisioned. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dpcExtras (String.t): The JSON-formatted EMM provisioning extras that are passed to the DPC. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dpcResourcePath (String.t): Required. The resource name of the selected DPC (device policy controller) in the format &#x60;customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/dpcs/*&#x60;. To list the supported DPCs, call &#x60;customers.dpcs.list&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isDefault (boolean()): Required. Whether this is the default configuration that zero-touch enrollment applies to any new devices the organization purchases in the future. Only one customer configuration can be the default. Setting this value to &#x60;true&#x60;, changes the previous default configuration&#39;s &#x60;isDefault&#x60; value to &#x60;false&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Output only. The API resource name in the format &#x60;customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/configurations/[CONFIGURATION_ID]&#x60;. Assigned by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
