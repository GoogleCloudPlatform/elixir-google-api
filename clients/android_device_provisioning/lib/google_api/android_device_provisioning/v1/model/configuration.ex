defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidDeviceProvisioning.V1.Model.Configuration do
  @moduledoc """
  A configuration collects the provisioning options for Android devices. Each
  configuration combines the following:

  * The EMM device policy controller (DPC) installed on the devices.
  * EMM policies enforced on the devices.
  * Metadata displayed on the device to help users during setup.

  Customers can add as many configurations as they need. However, zero-touch
  enrollment works best when a customer sets a default configuration that's
  applied to any new devices the organization purchases.

  ## Attributes

  - companyName (String.t): Required. The name of the organization. Zero-touch enrollment shows this
  organization name to device users during device provisioning. Defaults to `nil`.
  - configurationId (String.t): Output only. The ID of the configuration. Assigned by the server. Defaults to `nil`.
  - configurationName (String.t): Required. A short name that describes the configuration's purpose. For
  example, _Sales team_ or _Temporary employees_. The zero-touch enrollment
  portal displays this name to IT admins. Defaults to `nil`.
  - contactEmail (String.t): Required. The email address that device users can contact to get help.
  Zero-touch enrollment shows this email address to device users before
  device provisioning. The value is validated on input. Defaults to `nil`.
  - contactPhone (String.t): Required. The telephone number that device users can call, using another
  device, to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this number to device
  users before device provisioning. Accepts numerals, spaces, the plus sign,
  hyphens, and parentheses. Defaults to `nil`.
  - customMessage (String.t): A message, containing one or two sentences, to help device users get help
  or give them more details about whatâ€™s happening to their device.
  Zero-touch enrollment shows this message before the device is provisioned. Defaults to `nil`.
  - dpcExtras (String.t): The JSON-formatted EMM provisioning extras that are passed to the DPC. Defaults to `nil`.
  - dpcResourcePath (String.t): Required. The resource name of the selected DPC (device policy controller)
  in the format `customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/dpcs/*`. To list the supported DPCs,
  call
  `customers.dpcs.list`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - isDefault (boolean()): Required. Whether this is the default configuration that zero-touch
  enrollment applies to any new devices the organization purchases in the
  future. Only one customer configuration can be the default. Setting this
  value to `true`, changes the previous default configuration's `isDefault`
  value to `false`. Defaults to `nil`.
  - name (String.t): Output only. The API resource name in the format
  `customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/configurations/[CONFIGURATION_ID]`. Assigned by
  the server. Defaults to `nil`.
