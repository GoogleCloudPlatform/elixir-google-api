  - startDate (String.t): The requested start date in yyyy-mm-dd format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - totalMatchedRows (String.t): The total number of rows matched by the report request. Fewer rows may be returned in the response due to being limited by the row count requested or the report row limit. Defaults to: `null`.
