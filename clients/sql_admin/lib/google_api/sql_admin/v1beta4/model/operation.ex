defmodule GoogleApi.SQLAdmin.V1beta4.Model.Operation do
  @moduledoc """
  An Operations resource contains information about database instance operations such as create, delete, and restart. Operations resources are created in response to operations that were initiated; you never create them directly.

  ## Attributes

  - endTime (DateTime): The time this operation finished in UTC timezone in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z. Defaults to: `null`.
  - error (OperationErrors): If errors occurred during processing of this operation, this field will be populated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - exportContext (ExportContext): The context for export operation, if applicable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - importContext (ImportContext): The context for import operation, if applicable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - insertTime (DateTime): The time this operation was enqueued in UTC timezone in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): This is always sql#operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): An identifier that uniquely identifies the operation. You can use this identifier to retrieve the Operations resource that has information about the operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - operationType (String): The type of the operation. Valid values are CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE, RESTART, IMPORT, EXPORT, BACKUP_VOLUME, RESTORE_VOLUME, CREATE_USER, DELETE_USER, CREATE_DATABASE, DELETE_DATABASE . Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String): The URI of this resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startTime (DateTime): The time this operation actually started in UTC timezone in RFC 3339 format, for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String): The status of an operation. Valid values are PENDING, RUNNING, DONE, UNKNOWN. Defaults to: `null`.
  - targetId (String): Name of the database instance related to this operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - targetLink (String):  Defaults to: `null`.
