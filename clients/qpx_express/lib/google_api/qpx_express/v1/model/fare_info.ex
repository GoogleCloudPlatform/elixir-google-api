defmodule GoogleApi.QPXExpress.V1.Model.FareInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Complete information about a fare used in the solution to a low-fare search query. In the airline industry a fare is a price an airline charges for one-way travel between two points. A fare typically contains a carrier code, two city codes, a price, and a fare basis. (A fare basis is a one-to-eight character alphanumeric code used to identify a fare.)
