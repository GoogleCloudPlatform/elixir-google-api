defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.HttpRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  A common proto for logging HTTP requests. Only contains semantics defined by the HTTP specification. Product-specific logging information MUST be defined in a separate message.

  ## Attributes

  - cacheFillBytes (String.t): The number of HTTP response bytes inserted into cache. Set only when a cache fill was attempted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - cacheHit (boolean()): Whether or not an entity was served from cache (with or without validation). Defaults to: `null`.
  - cacheLookup (boolean()): Whether or not a cache lookup was attempted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - cacheValidatedWithOriginServer (boolean()): Whether or not the response was validated with the origin server before being served from cache. This field is only meaningful if cache_hit is True. Defaults to: `null`.
  - latency (String.t): The request processing latency on the server, from the time the request was received until the response was sent. Defaults to: `null`.
  - protocol (String.t): Protocol used for the request. Examples: \&quot;HTTP/1.1\&quot;, \&quot;HTTP/2\&quot;, \&quot;websocket\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - referer (String.t): The referer URL of the request, as defined in HTTP/1.1 Header Field Definitions (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). Defaults to: `null`.
  - remoteIp (String.t): The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the client that issued the HTTP request. Examples: \&quot;192.168.1.1\&quot;, \&quot;FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestMethod (String.t): The request method. Examples: \&quot;GET\&quot;, \&quot;HEAD\&quot;, \&quot;PUT\&quot;, \&quot;POST\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestSize (String.t): The size of the HTTP request message in bytes, including the request headers and the request body. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestUrl (String.t): The scheme (http, https), the host name, the path and the query portion of the URL that was requested. Example: \&quot;http://example.com/some/info?color&#x3D;red\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - responseSize (String.t): The size of the HTTP response message sent back to the client, in bytes, including the response headers and the response body. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serverIp (String.t): The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the origin server that the request was sent to. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (integer()): The response code indicating the status of response. Examples: 200, 404. Defaults to: `null`.
  - userAgent (String.t): The user agent sent by the client. Example: \&quot;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; Q312461; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
