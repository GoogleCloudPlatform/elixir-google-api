defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.LogEntrySourceLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Additional information about the source code location that produced the log entry.

  ## Attributes

  - file (String.t): Optional. Source file name. Depending on the runtime environment, this might be a simple name or a fully-qualified name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - function (String.t): Optional. Human-readable name of the function or method being invoked, with optional context such as the class or package name. This information may be used in contexts such as the logs viewer, where a file and line number are less meaningful. The format can vary by language. For example: qual.if.ied.Class.method (Java), dir/package.func (Go), function (Python). Defaults to: `null`.
  - line (String.t): Optional. Line within the source file. 1-based; 0 indicates no line number available. Defaults to: `null`.
