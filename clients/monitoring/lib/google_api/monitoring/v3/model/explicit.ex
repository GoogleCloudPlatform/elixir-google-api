Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 &lt;&#x3D; i &lt; N-1): boundsi  Lower bound (1 &lt;&#x3D; i &lt; N); boundsi - 1The bounds field must contain at least one element. If bounds has only one element, then there are no finite buckets, and that single element is the common boundary of the overflow and underflow buckets.
