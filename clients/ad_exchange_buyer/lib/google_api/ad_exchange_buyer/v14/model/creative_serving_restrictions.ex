  ## Attributes

  - contexts ([CreativeContexts1]): All known contexts/restrictions. Defaults to: `null`.
  - disapprovalReasons ([CreativeDisapprovalReasons]): The reasons for disapproval within this restriction, if any. Note that not all disapproval reasons may be categorized, so it is possible for the creative to have a status of DISAPPROVED or CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED with an empty list for disapproval_reasons. In this case, please reach out to your TAM to help debug the issue. Defaults to: `null`.
  - reason (String.t): Why the creative is ineligible to serve in this context (e.g., it has been explicitly disapproved or is pending review). Defaults to: `null`.
