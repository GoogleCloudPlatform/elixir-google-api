defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V14.Model.PricePerBuyer do
  @moduledoc """
  Used to specify pricing rules for buyers. Each PricePerBuyer in a product can become [0,1] deals. To check if there is a PricePerBuyer for a particular buyer we look for the most specific matching rule - we first look for a rule matching the buyer and otherwise look for a matching rule where no buyer is set.

  ## Attributes

  - auctionTier (String.t): Optional access type for this buyer. Defaults to: `null`.
  - billedBuyer (Buyer): Reference to the buyer that will get billed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - buyer (Buyer): The buyer who will pay this price. If unset, all buyers can pay this price (if the advertisers match, and there&#39;s no more specific rule matching the buyer). Defaults to: `null`.
  - price (Price): The specified price Defaults to: `null`.
