  ## Attributes

  - additionalExperiments ([String.t]): Additional experiment flags for the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - additionalUserLabels (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Additional user labels to be specified for the job. Keys and values should follow the restrictions specified in the [labeling restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources#restrictions) page. Defaults to: `null`.
  - bypassTempDirValidation (boolean()): Whether to bypass the safety checks for the job&#39;s temporary directory. Use with caution. Defaults to: `null`.
  - machineType (String.t): The machine type to use for the job. Defaults to the value from the template if not specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maxWorkers (integer()): The maximum number of Google Compute Engine instances to be made available to your pipeline during execution, from 1 to 1000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - network (String.t): Network to which VMs will be assigned.  If empty or unspecified, the service will use the network \&quot;default\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - numWorkers (integer()): The initial number of Google Compute Engine instnaces for the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceAccountEmail (String.t): The email address of the service account to run the job as. Defaults to: `null`.
  - subnetwork (String.t): Subnetwork to which VMs will be assigned, if desired.  Expected to be of the form \&quot;regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNETWORK\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tempLocation (String.t): The Cloud Storage path to use for temporary files. Must be a valid Cloud Storage URL, beginning with &#x60;gs://&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
