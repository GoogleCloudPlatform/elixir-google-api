defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.SourceSplitResponse do
  @moduledoc """
  The response to a SourceSplitRequest.

  ## Attributes

  - bundles ([DerivedSource]): If outcome is SPLITTING_HAPPENED, then this is a list of bundles into which the source was split. Otherwise this field is ignored. This list can be empty, which means the source represents an empty input. Defaults to: `null`.
  - outcome (String.t): Indicates whether splitting happened and produced a list of bundles. If this is USE_CURRENT_SOURCE_AS_IS, the current source should be processed \&quot;as is\&quot; without splitting. \&quot;bundles\&quot; is ignored in this case. If this is SPLITTING_HAPPENED, then \&quot;bundles\&quot; contains a list of bundles into which the source was split. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN, SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT, SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_SPLITTING_HAPPENED]
  - shards ([SourceSplitShard]): DEPRECATED in favor of bundles. Defaults to: `null`.
