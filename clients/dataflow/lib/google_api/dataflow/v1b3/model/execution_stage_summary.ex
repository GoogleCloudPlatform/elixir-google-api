defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.ExecutionStageSummary do
  @moduledoc """
  Description of the composing transforms, names/ids, and input/outputs of a stage of execution.  Some composing transforms and sources may have been generated by the Dataflow service during execution planning.

  ## Attributes

  - componentSource (List[ComponentSource]): Collections produced and consumed by component transforms of this stage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - componentTransform (List[ComponentTransform]): Transforms that comprise this execution stage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String): Dataflow service generated id for this stage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - inputSource (List[StageSource]): Input sources for this stage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String): Type of tranform this stage is executing. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN_KIND, PAR_DO_KIND, GROUP_BY_KEY_KIND, FLATTEN_KIND, READ_KIND, WRITE_KIND, CONSTANT_KIND, SINGLETON_KIND, SHUFFLE_KIND]
  - name (String): Dataflow service generated name for this stage. Defaults to: `null`.
  - outputSource (List[StageSource]): Output sources for this stage. Defaults to: `null`.
