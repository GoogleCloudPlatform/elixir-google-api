defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.ApproximateReportedProgress do
  @moduledoc """
  A progress measurement of a WorkItem by a worker.

  ## Attributes

  - consumedParallelism (ReportedParallelism): Total amount of parallelism in the portion of input of this task that has already been consumed and is no longer active. In the first two examples above (see remaining_parallelism), the value should be 29 or 2 respectively.  The sum of remaining_parallelism and consumed_parallelism should equal the total amount of parallelism in this work item.  If specified, must be finite. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fractionConsumed (Float): Completion as fraction of the input consumed, from 0.0 (beginning, nothing consumed), to 1.0 (end of the input, entire input consumed). Defaults to: `null`.
  - position (Position): A Position within the work to represent a progress. Defaults to: `null`.
  - remainingParallelism (ReportedParallelism): Total amount of parallelism in the input of this task that remains, (i.e. can be delegated to this task and any new tasks via dynamic splitting). Always at least 1 for non-finished work items and 0 for finished.  \&quot;Amount of parallelism\&quot; refers to how many non-empty parts of the input can be read in parallel. This does not necessarily equal number of records. An input that can be read in parallel down to the individual records is called \&quot;perfectly splittable\&quot;. An example of non-perfectly parallelizable input is a block-compressed file format where a block of records has to be read as a whole, but different blocks can be read in parallel.  Examples: * If we are processing record #30 (starting at 1) out of 50 in a perfectly   splittable 50-record input, this value should be 21 (20 remaining + 1   current). * If we are reading through block 3 in a block-compressed file consisting   of 5 blocks, this value should be 3 (since blocks 4 and 5 can be   processed in parallel by new tasks via dynamic splitting and the current   task remains processing block 3). * If we are reading through the last block in a block-compressed file,   or reading or processing the last record in a perfectly splittable   input, this value should be 1, because apart from the current task, no   additional remainder can be split off. Defaults to: `null`.
