defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.InstructionOutput do
  @moduledoc """
  An output of an instruction.

  ## Attributes

  - codec (Object): The codec to use to encode data being written via this output. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): The user-provided name of this output. Defaults to: `null`.
  - onlyCountKeyBytes (Boolean): For system-generated byte and mean byte metrics, certain instructions should only report the key size. Defaults to: `null`.
  - onlyCountValueBytes (Boolean): For system-generated byte and mean byte metrics, certain instructions should only report the value size. Defaults to: `null`.
  - originalName (String): System-defined name for this output in the original workflow graph. Outputs that do not contribute to an original instruction do not set this. Defaults to: `null`.
  - systemName (String): System-defined name of this output. Unique across the workflow. Defaults to: `null`.
