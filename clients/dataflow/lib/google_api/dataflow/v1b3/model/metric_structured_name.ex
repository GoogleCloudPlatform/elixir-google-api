  Identifies a metric, by describing the source which generated the metric.

  ## Attributes

  - context (Map[String, String]): Zero or more labeled fields which identify the part of the job this metric is associated with, such as the name of a step or collection.  For example, built-in counters associated with steps will have context[&#39;step&#39;] &#x3D; &lt;step-name&gt;. Counters associated with PCollections in the SDK will have context[&#39;pcollection&#39;] &#x3D; &lt;pcollection-name&gt;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): Worker-defined metric name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - origin (String): Origin (namespace) of metric name. May be blank for user-define metrics; will be \&quot;dataflow\&quot; for metrics defined by the Dataflow service or SDK. Defaults to: `null`.
