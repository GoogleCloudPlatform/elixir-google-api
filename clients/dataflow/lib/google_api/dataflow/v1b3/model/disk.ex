defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.Disk do
  @moduledoc """
  Describes the data disk used by a workflow job.

  ## Attributes

  - diskType (String.t): Disk storage type, as defined by Google Compute Engine.  This must be a disk type appropriate to the project and zone in which the workers will run.  If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.  For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in \&quot;pd-standard\&quot;.  If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with \&quot;pd-ssd\&quot;.  The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone.  Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this:  compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard Defaults to: `null`.
  - mountPoint (String.t): Directory in a VM where disk is mounted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sizeGb (integer()): Size of disk in GB.  If zero or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. Defaults to: `null`.
