defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.CounterStructuredName do
  @moduledoc """
  Identifies a counter within a per-job namespace. Counters whose structured names are the same get merged into a single value for the job.

  ## Attributes

  - componentStepName (String): Name of the optimized step being executed by the workers. Defaults to: `null`.
  - executionStepName (String): Name of the stage. An execution step contains multiple component steps. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String): Counter name. Not necessarily globally-unique, but unique within the context of the other fields. Required. Defaults to: `null`.
  - origin (String): One of the standard Origins defined above. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [SYSTEM, USER]
  - originNamespace (String): A string containing a more specific namespace of the counter&#39;s origin. Defaults to: `null`.
  - originalStepName (String): System generated name of the original step in the user&#39;s graph, before optimization. Defaults to: `null`.
  - portion (String): Portion of this counter, either key or value. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [ALL, KEY, VALUE]
  - workerId (String): ID of a particular worker. Defaults to: `null`.
