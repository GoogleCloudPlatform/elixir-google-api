defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.Position do
  @moduledoc """
  Position defines a position within a collection of data.  The value can be either the end position, a key (used with ordered collections), a byte offset, or a record index.

  ## Attributes

  - byteOffset (String): Position is a byte offset. Defaults to: `null`.
  - concatPosition (ConcatPosition): CloudPosition is a concat position. Defaults to: `null`.
  - end (Boolean): Position is past all other positions. Also useful for the end position of an unbounded range. Defaults to: `null`.
  - key (String): Position is a string key, ordered lexicographically. Defaults to: `null`.
  - recordIndex (String): Position is a record index. Defaults to: `null`.
  - shufflePosition (String): CloudPosition is a base64 encoded BatchShufflePosition (with FIXED sharding). Defaults to: `null`.
