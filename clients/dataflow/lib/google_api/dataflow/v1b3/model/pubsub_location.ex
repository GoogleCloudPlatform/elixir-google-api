defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.PubsubLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Identifies a pubsub location to use for transferring data into or out of a streaming Dataflow job.

  ## Attributes

  - dropLateData (Boolean): Indicates whether the pipeline allows late-arriving data. Defaults to: `null`.
  - idLabel (String): If set, contains a pubsub label from which to extract record ids. If left empty, record deduplication will be strictly best effort. Defaults to: `null`.
  - subscription (String): A pubsub subscription, in the form of \&quot;pubsub.googleapis.com/subscriptions/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;subscription-name&gt;\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - timestampLabel (String): If set, contains a pubsub label from which to extract record timestamps. If left empty, record timestamps will be generated upon arrival. Defaults to: `null`.
  - topic (String): A pubsub topic, in the form of \&quot;pubsub.googleapis.com/topics/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;topic-name&gt;\&quot; Defaults to: `null`.
  - trackingSubscription (String): If set, specifies the pubsub subscription that will be used for tracking custom time timestamps for watermark estimation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - withAttributes (Boolean): If true, then the client has requested to get pubsub attributes. Defaults to: `null`.
